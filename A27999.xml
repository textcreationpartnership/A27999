            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WE ≈øee in Your Lord≈øhip ≈øuch a plain and familiar Example of that Wi≈ødom which <hi>SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON</hi> preaches in the Book of <hi>EC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLESIASTES,</hi> that I am invited thereby to this boldne≈øs of prefixing Your Lord≈øhip's Name before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphra≈øe I have made upon it, and upon the Book that follows it.</p>
                  <p>A Wi≈ødom, which hath rai≈øed Your Mind above the deceitfulne≈øs of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of all Worldly Glories: a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wi≈ødom, which hath rai≈øed You above your ≈øelf; and made the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ≈øervice of God, and of the King, the ≈øole ≈øcope of all Your Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>It is a token ≈øurely of the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards us, and ought to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb facs="tcp:46873:3"/>among the felicities of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's Reign, that a Vertue ≈øo active and laborious in doing good, is placed in ≈øuch a wide and capacious Sphere, as that wherein Your Lord≈øhip moves.

                  <p>Some ≈ømall ≈øervice I hope I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Explication of the≈øe two holy Books.

Which Rock I have carefully avoided; and ≈øteered my Cour≈øe by ≈øuch a clear and certain Direction (which I thought I e≈øpied in other holy Writings) that if I have kept my eye ≈øtedfa≈øtly fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I am ≈øatisfied hath not mi≈øled me, but carried me to the right ≈øen≈øe of this admirable Piece of Divine Poetry.</p>

                     <hi>I.</hi> THis Book not carrying in the front of it the expre≈øs Name of <hi>SOLOMON,</hi> it hath emboldned ≈øome to take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of intitling other Authors to it. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for in≈øtance, whom the <hi>Talmudi≈øts</hi> make to ≈øpeak tho≈øe Words in the entrance of it, <hi>The words of the Preacher,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> as R. <hi>Mo≈øes Kimchi,</hi> with ≈øome other Jews, fan≈øie: Or, to name no more, <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> whom <hi>Grotius</hi> (in his Notes upon Chap. <hi>XII. 11.</hi>) conjectures to have appointed certain men to make this <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For ≈øo he would have the word <hi>COHELETH</hi> tran≈ølated, a <hi>Collector;</hi> or Heaper up of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rather than a <hi>Preacher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> But there are ≈øo many pa≈ø≈øages in the Book which agree to none but <hi>Solomon,</hi> that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øo great a man as <hi>Grotius</hi> ≈øhould be led away from the common Opinion, by ≈øuch ≈ølight rea≈øons, as I ≈øhall pre≈øently mention. For in≈øtance, there never was any Body that could truly ≈øpeak tho≈øe words which we read v. <hi>16.</hi> of the fir≈øt Chapter, but only <hi>Solomon.</hi> For neither <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> nor <hi>Jo≈øiah,</hi> nor <hi>Zorobabel</hi> kept ≈øuch great State, as he did, much le≈øs excelled him in Wi≈ødom. And who but he could boa≈øt of ≈øuch things as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="tcp:46873:5"/>Chap. II. v. <hi>4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</hi> to repre≈øent the ≈øplendour wherein he lived, above all that had been before him in <hi>Jeru≈øalem?</hi> Or, on the contrary, Who had ≈øuch rea≈øon as he, to make that ≈øad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (Chap. VII. <hi>26, &amp;c.</hi>) of the mi≈øchief he had received by Women? And to omit the re≈øt, tho≈øe words in the la≈øt Chapter, v. <hi>9, 10.</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none but him, who <hi>≈øet in order</hi> many <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as appears in the foregoing Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> Which things are ≈øo convincing, that <hi>Grotius</hi> is forced to acknowledge that <hi>Zorobabel</hi> cau≈øed this Book to be compo≈øed in the Name of King <hi>Solomon</hi> (for he was no King him≈øelf, but a Governour under the King of <hi>Per≈øia</hi>) repenting of his former vain and ≈øinful life. Which very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment carries in it a plain ≈øolution of the principal Argument, whereby he was led to this odd Opinion: Which is, that he finds ≈øome words in this Book, that are no where to be met withal, but in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Which makes it probable, he thinks, that it was written after their Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But ≈øuppo≈øing <hi>Solomon</hi> to write here as a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, after he had frequented the Company of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Outlandi≈øh Women (of whom we read <hi>1 Kings</hi> XI. <hi>1, 2.</hi>) it need not ≈øeem ≈øtrange to us that he had learnt the u≈øe of many of their words. And ≈øo, notwith≈øtanding this Objection, he may ≈øtill be thought to have been the Author of this Book him≈øelf: which the Hebrews generally conceive to have been written by him, towards the end of his Reign; after he had tried all manner of plea≈øures,
<pb facs="tcp:46873:5"/>even to an exce≈øs. Be≈øides, in other Books of Scripture there are words, for the ≈øignification of which we are fain to have re≈øort unto other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and particularly the <hi>Arabick;</hi> becau≈øe they are not to be found el≈øewhere in the Scripture: and yet, for all that, might be pure Hebrew, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the language which was then ≈øpoken, when ≈øuch Books were written.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> But it is not fit to ≈øtay any longer, in the confutation of ≈øuch a weak rea≈øon as this; which hath no force in it (though it be the be≈øt he hath) to make us think of any other Author of this Book, than <hi>Solomon.</hi> Who, if he did not write it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf it is certain ≈øpake the things contained in it: and calls him≈øelf the <hi>PREACHER,</hi> becau≈øe of the great gravity and dignity of the Subject, whereof he treats; of which he was wont to ≈øpeak frequently (Chap. XII. <hi>9.</hi>) de≈øiring it might be under≈øtood and laid to heart, by the <hi>whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> of I≈ørael; as the Word <hi>Coheleth</hi> ≈øeems to import; which in the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> language ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Circle,</hi> or a Company of men gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the form of a <hi>Circle,</hi> as <hi>Ludolphus</hi> hath lately ob≈øerved. For the ≈øcope of this Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe is concerning the <hi>chief Good</hi> or happine≈øs of man: the <hi>great end</hi> he ≈øhould propo≈øe to him≈øelf all his life long. Which is not that, he ≈øhows, which men generally follow: but that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neglected. For mo≈øt men mind nothing, but ju≈øt what is before them: which they will find at la≈øt, as he had done by ≈øad experience, to be mere vanity; utterly unable to quiet their minds.

                  <p>The Propo≈øition is evident in it ≈øelf; and needs no Proof. The A≈ø≈øumption therefore he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates

                  <p>Such indeed is the dulne≈øs of Mankind, that, hearing all was but vanity, they might condemn every thing as evil and hurtful; and declaim too bitterly again≈øt this World.

                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> The de≈øign of the Author is to find out and to ≈øhew, What it is, in which the chief good and compleat felicity of man doth con≈øi≈øt. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that reflecting upon various things in which men place their happine≈øs; at the end of his Di≈øcour≈øe upon every one of them, he rejects them as utterly in≈øufficient for that purpo≈øe: but continues his ≈øearch ≈øo far till at la≈øt he finds it, and declares in the concluding <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> that he had been ≈øeeking it, through the whole Di≈øcour≈øe, ≈øaying, the ≈øumm of the matter is this, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are two principal Parts of the whole <hi>Sermon,</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which contains a recital, and confutation, of mens fal≈øe Opinions about their Chiefe≈øt Good: the <hi>other</hi> teaches, in what our genuine, true and ≈øolid felicity lies; both in this life, and in the next. In both he ≈øhows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deligently, what is the end to which a man ≈øhould
<pb facs="tcp:46873:8"/>direct all his Coun≈øels, Studies and Endeavours, what he ought to follow, as mo≈øt de≈øirable above all things; and what to avoid, as the extreame≈øt of evils.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of the≈øe he treats in his <hi>VI.</hi> fir≈øt Chapters; of the other in as many more that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

For being to treat of felicity, it was but fitting he ≈øhould divide it into <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> and <hi>true;</hi> and then define aright what that true felicity is. For we mu≈øt fir≈øt ≈øhun that which is evil, and then pur≈øue that which is good: according to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent admonitions we meet withal in the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>

But to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> nothing was more ea≈øie; who having made a full and long experiment of all enjoyments here, mo≈øt evidently demon≈øtrates this by an enumeration of Parts, and that in an apt, per≈øpicuous, and compendious order. For he neither confounds the
<pb facs="tcp:46873:8"/>parts; nor too curiou≈øly pur≈øues them; nor menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all the fal≈øe Opinions of men about the chiefe≈øt Good (which would have been too tedious, if like <hi>Varro</hi> he had told us of <hi>two hundred, eighty five,</hi> and yet that he could not reckon all) but reducing the mo≈øt probable Opinions unto <hi>four</hi> principal Heads, he confutes them by various Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; drawn chiefly from adjuncts and effects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is of tho≈øe who place Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs in the knowledge of natural things, and in humane Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which begins at the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Ver≈øe of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Chapter, and reaches to the beginning of the <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> For in the precedent Ver≈øes, he only lays a foundation for his Di≈øcour≈øe, and plains his way to the proof of what he intended.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> is of tho≈øe who place it in plea≈øure; which he di≈øpatches, as unworthy of a long confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the three fir≈øt Ver≈øes of the ≈øecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But there being tho≈øe of this Sect, who join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the≈øe two together, <hi>plea≈øure</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> imagine they will make up a complete happine≈øs; he ≈øpends more time in ≈øhowing their Vanity; from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ver≈øe of the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Chapter, to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ver≈øe of the <hi>third:</hi> interpo≈øing only a <hi>Parenthe≈øis,</hi> wherein he compares <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> with <hi>Folly;</hi> and from the effects of both ≈øhews how much the former is to be preferred before the latter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> touches tho≈øe who think Honours, Magi≈øtracies, and Power in the Commonwealth, to be the highe≈øt of all Goods. In which number are they, who ≈øeek to extend their Empire, though it be by a va≈øt effu≈øion of their own Subjects blood;

Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he gives us a lively de≈øcription, of <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and <hi>Covetou≈øne≈øs:</hi> two of the foule≈øt and mo≈øt cruel pe≈øts of the Commonwealth. In the <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter al≈øo he in≈øerts a Di≈øcour≈øe of that ≈øuper≈øtitious and vain Wor≈øhip of God; in which ≈øome, de≈øpi≈øing all other things, place their ≈øatisfaction: and mo≈øt lamentably applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in it.

                        <hi>X.</hi> Then follows the <hi>≈øecond,</hi> and mo≈øt Elegant as well as u≈øeful part of the Sermon. In which
<pb facs="tcp:46873:9"/>he teaches, that the felicity, for which men take ≈øo much pains (every one going his own way to it) is not to be found any where, but in a religious and ≈øerious fear of God: according to that of the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are all they that fear the Lord; that walk in his ways;</hi> and again, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man that feareth the Lord; that delighteth greatly in his Commandments.</hi> For other things; though they promi≈øe felicity, yet they cannot perform it; becau≈øe they have ≈øuch a mixture of vanity, trouble and grief with them, as will not ≈øuffer them to be ab≈øolutely good; and becau≈øe, if they were ≈øincere, yet they being ≈øo uncertain that they may be lo≈øt before we dye, and at the be≈øt are terminated within the narrow Bounds of this ≈øhort life; they cannot give that ≈øatisfaction and quiet of mind, which we de≈øire. But the fear of God is ≈øuch a Good that it both gives true contentment, ≈øatisfaction and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, as long as we live; and when we die, fills us with a ≈øure hope of a better life: in which true and genuine felicity is accompli≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>For the ≈øumm of what can be ≈øaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be reduced to this Argumentation:</p>
                     <p>That which can make a mans mind quiet, ≈øtill and calm, both in life and death; that alone can make him happy;</p>
                     <p>Now this the Fear of the Lord can do for him, and this alone:</p>
                     <p>Therefore this, and nothing el≈øe, will make him a happy man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:46873:10"/>
The Propo≈øition needs no Proof; For then we feel our ≈øelves happy, when our minds are ≈øo quiet and well plea≈øed; that they neither grieve, nor fear, nor ≈øolicitou≈øly de≈øire, nor vainly hope for uncertain things: but re≈øt ≈øatisfied in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and mo≈øt certain joy and hope, which ari≈øes out of a pure Con≈øcience.</p>
                     <p>The A≈ø≈øumption is proved from <hi>two</hi> effects of the Fear of God, viz. <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtice.</hi> The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which teaches us what to follow, and what to fly: and furni≈øhes us with ≈øuch caution, that we be not impo≈øed on, in the choice of that which ≈øeems to be good for us. The <hi>other</hi> in≈øtructs us to do our whole Duty, towards God, towards our Neighbour, and towards our ≈øelves.

                     <p>And becau≈øe effects are more known than their cau≈øes, and it would be uncertain what he meant by the fear of God, unle≈øs he explained it by tho≈øe things wherein it con≈øi≈øts; he begins his Di≈øputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this Subject with tho≈øe effects; and employs him≈øelf wholly in ≈øhewing what are the Offices of <hi>Wi≈ødom</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtice:</hi> that he might inform us not only what is the Chief Good, to which we ought to a≈øpire; but by what ways and means we may come at it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46873:12"/>and in a ≈øure and certain hope of a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other. <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pon which account, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcates this coun≈øel, That they who are ≈øtudious to fear God, and do well, being ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of God's Admini≈øtration and of the event of things, ≈øhould enjoy the pre≈øent good things, which his Divine Bounty be≈øtows upon them; with cheerful minds, and with thank≈øgiving to Him.

                        <hi>XIII.</hi> The re≈øt of the Work is his <hi>Perorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> in which he fully opens his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Chief Good: which he confirms to
<pb facs="tcp:46873:12"/>lie wholly in a truly religious Fear of God. Which therefore he ≈øeriou≈øly exhorts every one to make their ≈øtudy as early as is po≈ø≈øible: before dull and unactive Old Age, and Death it ≈øelf, (both which he elegantly de≈øcribes) come upon us, and, before we think of it, oppre≈øs us.</p>
                     <p>This is the method of this mo≈øt excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: which I cannot but exhort all men to ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diligently, and with great intention of mind; both for the Authors ≈øake, and for the matter of it. Which he handles in ≈øuch a manner, as fir≈øt to draw us from the de≈øire and love of earthly things; and from the perver≈øe u≈øe of them: and then to lead us unto the true and lawful u≈øe of them, without any offence to God, as well as without hurt to our ≈øelves. And he teaches us how we may, without a prepo≈øterous ≈øolicitude and anxiety about events, enjoy all things in the Fear of God; with tranquility and ≈øatisfaction of mind at pre≈øent; and at la≈øt, by the ≈øame Fear of God and ob≈øervance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, arrive at a never-dying felicity.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, He inter≈øper≈øes through the whole Di≈øcour≈øe abundance of Common Places, both Philo≈øophical and Theological; which are ≈øo fitted to make us every way more learned, more prudent, and more pious; that we ≈øhall find great u≈øe of them in all the pa≈ø≈øages of our lives.</p>

                        <hi>XIV.</hi> Thus that learned <hi>Spaniard</hi> concludes his Preface: which I have contracted, that I might ≈øet before the Readers eyes in one ≈øhort view, both the de≈øign and the procedure of the Di≈øcour≈øe.
<pb facs="tcp:46873:13"/>Of the former (the De≈øign) there is no doubt: and the latter is very regular, as it will further appear, in the explication I ≈øhall give of it. Wherein I have not followed this Author through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in every Part of this Divi≈øion of the Book; becau≈øe, though for the mo≈øt part I take it to be accurate enough; yet, I think, in ≈øeveral places I had rea≈øon to differ from him; and take another way to make the connexion more ea≈øie and natural; and the ≈øen≈øe thereby more clear and evident.</p>
                     <p>I be≈øeech God, that the pains I have taken herein may not be in vain; but prove an effectual means both to make the mind of <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Book better under≈øtood; and to turn all our minds from the≈øe frivolous things, about which now they are too much employed, unto the ≈øolid and full Good which here he recommends to us. Who may be the better tru≈øted in what he ≈øaith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he had tried what ≈øatisfaction could be found in all manner of enjoyments here: and it could not be objected to him that he di≈øparaged the World, merely becau≈øe he could not get any ≈øhare in it, or had not the liberty which was nece≈ø≈øary to enjoy it. For no man ever had greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or gave a greater loo≈øe to his de≈øires; but, after all the experiments he could make, came to this re≈øolution which he had better have taken at fir≈øt; that Religion and Vertue are the only things can make a man happy.</p>
                     <p>And perhaps, as God ≈øuffered St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to doubt of our Saviour's Re≈øurrection, for the greater confirmation of our Faith; by the ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb facs="tcp:46873:13"/>he at la≈øt received: ≈øo he let this great man go a≈øtray, that by his dear-bought experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he might teach us this Wi≈ødom; to keep the clo≈øer to God in faithful obedience.</p>
                     <p>Which it will be a very great ≈øhame, it we do not learn, who live under the in≈øtruction of a greater Ma≈øter than <hi>Solomon;</hi> the Son of God him≈øelf. By whom we are taught the≈øe things in a more effectual manner; not only by his Doctrine, but by his whole life, and by his death: in which he declared the greate≈øt neglect and contempt of this World; and that his mind was wholly ≈øet upon the other.</p>
                     <p>And what a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øort of <hi>Reformation</hi> would it be, if (as <hi>Era≈ømus</hi> ≈øomewhere admirably ≈øpeaks) we would all lay a≈øide our di≈ø≈øen≈øions, ≈øtrifes, and quarrels, and ≈øtudy the Le≈ø≈øons our Lord hath taught us.

This he proclaims with a loud voice; de≈øiring ≈øerious attention to ≈øuch a weighty Di≈øcour≈øe, and that they would often recollect, as he had done (all which may be the import of the word <hi>Koheleth</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">See Preface, num. IV.</note>) how frivolous and trivial, all tho≈øe things are, which mo≈øt men pur≈øue with the greate≈øt earne≈øtne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.</hi> This is the Subject of this Book; to ≈øhow how ≈øen≈øle≈øs it is to place our happine≈øs in the≈øe frail and incon≈øtant things, that we enjoy upon this Earth: which he not only pronounces, but proves to be mere emptine≈øs. So <hi>Vanity</hi> ≈øignifies; and what is con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon that, di≈ø≈øatisfaction, trouble and affliction. See <hi>P≈øal.</hi> LXXVIII. <hi>33.</hi> And this, beyond what can be expre≈ø≈øed: for our Tran≈ølators take it to be a word of the ≈øame import with <hi>Tohu;</hi> which is u≈øed in the Hebrew language, when they would ≈øignifie that of which they ≈øpeak, to be ≈øo trivial, that it is below le≈øs than nothing, XL. <hi>I≈øai. 17.</hi> And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> is not content with this ≈øingle word, but doubles it; to denote the extreme di≈ø≈øatisfaction he found in all things, which made a ≈øhow of affording him contentment; but performed nothing of that which they ≈øeemed to promi≈øe. So the Word <hi>Vanity</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46873:19"/>is al≈øo u≈øed for that which is fal≈øe, lying and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, LXII. <hi>P≈øal. 9.</hi> and other places, where <hi>Idols</hi> are called <hi>Vanities.</hi>

And then the body of man <hi>(V. 4.)</hi> which, as proud and lofty as it now looks, mu≈øt moulder into Du≈øt; and the poore≈øt per≈øon perhaps ≈øhall tread upon its Grave. For it cannot la≈øt like the Earth, from whence it comes; which ≈øtands for ever, as a publick Theatre, whereon men enter and act their Part, and then go off and never appear again: and when they go (as ≈øome prettily rather than ≈øolidly glo≈øs upon tho≈øe Words, <hi>The Earth abideth for ever</hi>) they can carry none of it along with them, but leave it all behind them, unto tho≈øe that come after; who pa≈øs away al≈øo, leaving the Earth where they found it.</p>

So the <hi>fifth</hi> Ver≈øe ≈øeems to be mo≈øt naturally connected with the foregoing; and in like manner the <hi>≈øixth</hi> and <hi>≈øeventh</hi> Ver≈øes are to be expounded. There are many Interpreters indeed, who look upon the things mentioned in the≈øe three Ver≈øes, only as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of the in≈øtability of all humane Affairs, and of the con≈øtant revolutions of the ≈øame mi≈øeries: which cannot be hindred by any humane coun≈øels, but will return after all the changes, whereby we think to mend our ≈øelves. Upon which ≈øen≈øe I have ju≈øt touched in my Paraphra≈øe, but not followed it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it doth not ≈øeem to me to be the ≈øcope of the≈øe Ver≈øes.

How ≈øhould he? when his whole bu≈øine≈øs here is only to do and to enjoy the very ≈øame things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again: as all men have done before us, and ≈øhall do after us, v. <hi>9, 10, 11.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 9.</hi> We may fan≈øie indeed, that we have found ≈øome new thing: but this conceit proceeds merely from our ignorance; as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> excellently di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes in his fir≈øt Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi> Chap. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <q>Learning and Knowledge, <hi>≈øaith he,</hi> takes away vain and exce≈ø≈øive admiration; which is the very root of all weak coun≈øels. For we admire things, either becau≈øe they are <hi>new,</hi> or becau≈øe they are <hi>great.</hi> As for <hi>Novelty,</hi> there is no man that con≈øiders things thoroughly, but hath this printed in his heart, <hi>There is nothing new under the Sun:</hi> nor can any man much admire a Puppet-Play, who doth but thru≈øt his head behind the Curtain, and ≈øeeth the In≈øtruments and Wires whereby they are moved. As for <hi>Greatne≈øs,</hi> we may ≈øay as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> who, after his great Conque≈øts in <hi>A≈øia,</hi> receiving Letters of ≈øome ≈ømall Fights or Skirmi≈øhes in <hi>Greece,</hi> at the taking of ≈øome Bridge, or Fort, was wont to tell his Friends, that <hi>it ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that they had ≈øent him News of the Battles of</hi> Homer<hi>'s Frogs and Mice:</hi> ≈øo, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if a man con≈øider the Univer≈øe, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of it, to him this Globe of Earth with the men upon it, and their bu≈øie motions (excepting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Divinene≈øs of Souls) will not ≈øeem much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46873:20"/>more con≈øiderable than <hi>an Hillock of Ants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øome creep up and down with their Corn, others with their Eggs, others empty: all about a very little heap of Du≈øt.</hi>
                        </q> And as <hi>Melancthon</hi> well ob≈øerves, the ≈øame de≈øires, the ≈øame coun≈øels, the ≈øame ends, the ≈øame cau≈øes of War, and calamitous events, return again: according to that of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, While humane nature continues what it is, the like mi≈øchiefs will happen; ≈øometimes le≈øs, ≈øometimes more direfully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 12.</hi> Thus having confirmed his main Propo≈øitions, by ≈øuch general Arguments as reach to all things in this World; he proceeds here to a more particular proof of it, from his own proper experience. And de≈øigning (before he declared his own Opinion of the Chief Good, and by what means it may be attained) to confute the vain fancies of men about it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them, as I have ≈øhown in the Preface, to <hi>four</hi> Heads. And ob≈øerving that ≈øome place it in <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and curious inquiries into all manner of things, others in <hi>plea≈øure,</hi> or in <hi>both</hi> the≈øe together; others in <hi>honour</hi> and power; others in <hi>riches</hi> and heaps of wealth; he begins with that which is the mo≈øt plau≈øible. And demon≈øtrates, from the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ver≈øe to the end of this Chapter, how little ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be found in the mere ≈øpeculation of things; though a man arrive at the highe≈øt degree of humane knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 13, 14. Melancthon</hi> re≈øtrains the≈øe <hi>two</hi> Ver≈øes, to political Wi≈ødom, in the Government of Kingdoms. Which gives men a double affliction: <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> in that the Wi≈øe≈øt men often err in their coun≈øels; and <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that events ≈øometimes do not an≈øwer to the be≈øt coun≈øels that men can follow. Examples of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> are innumerable: Sometime they err through ambition, as <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> after <hi>Alexander;</hi> ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time through a fal≈øe opinion of Right, as <hi>Brutus;</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46873:21"/>≈øometime, through over-doing, bu≈øie headedne≈øs and inquietude of mind, as <hi>Pericles;</hi> ≈øometime through anger, as <hi>Marius.</hi> And how many ways good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels have mi≈øcarried, it is too long here to remember: becau≈øe, it is here further ob≈øervable, that ≈øometime more doubtfulne≈øs and uncertainty of mind what cour≈øe to take, is as great a torment to the mind as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> was fir≈øt perplexed in his Coun≈øels, before he ≈øaw the di≈øa≈øtrous event of his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. To conclude this; All Government is ≈øo full of cares, perplexities, and impediments, that it made <hi>Demo≈øthenes</hi> ≈øay, If he were to begin the World again, he would rather die than be promoted to it. And <hi>Ae≈øchines,</hi> that he was as glad when he was rid of his Office, as he would have been to be delivered from a mad Dog.</p>
                     <p>But this I take to be too ≈øtraight a ≈øen≈øe; though it be agreeable enough to what he ≈øaith v. <hi>12.</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office: and therefore I have inlarged it further in my <hi>Paraphra≈øe;</hi> though <hi>Greg.

                        <hi>[i] V. 14.</hi> The word we tran≈ølate <hi>vexation</hi> is found on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Book, and is capable of many ≈øen≈øes, all pertinent to the ≈øcope of this place. For according to the ≈øeveral Fountains from whence it may be derived; this Phra≈øe may be interpreted, either <hi>angui≈øh</hi> of Spirit, or <hi>breaking</hi> of Spirit, or <hi>preying upon</hi> the Spirits; or (in another ≈øen≈øe of the word Spirit) <hi>feeding on the Wind or Air:</hi> none of which I have neglected in the Parapra≈øe.</p>

                        <hi>[k] V. 15.</hi> The ≈øhortne≈øs of humane Wit, though never ≈øo much improved, is here repre≈øented by two things:

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46873:22"/>and Coun≈øels contemned, or our Projects and well laid De≈øigns defeated. Such as was in <hi>Achitophel;</hi> who≈øe penetrating Wit made his rage the greater, to ≈øee his judicious advice rejected, and the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiracy utterly di≈øappointed. The <hi>other</hi> word <hi>(≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row)</hi> properly denotes an extreme great trouble and ≈øickne≈øs of mind; and is ≈øometimes applied to pains in the Body: which is the effect too frequently of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard ≈øtudy <hi>Melancthon</hi> under≈øtands the whole Ver≈øe (as he did v. <hi>13, 14.</hi>) of the trouble that wi≈øe men have, when they are intru≈øted with Government, to ≈øee the confu≈øions, errors, vices and calamities of Mankind. And their afflictions are the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are not only more ≈øen≈øible than other men of pre≈øent evils, but fore≈øee by the pre≈øent tho≈øe that are future: and therefore are tormented with a ≈øore pain and grief, both for what they feel and for what they fear. For they know, that from the fir≈øt di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there commonly follow greater confu≈øions: as when <hi>Pericles</hi> had once ≈øtirred up a War, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the de≈øtruction of almo≈øt all the great Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi> And it is too truly ≈øaid by <hi>Pindar,</hi> that <hi>it is ea≈øie for any body to di≈øturb a City; but God alone can re≈øtore peace unto it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be too limited a ≈øen≈øe; but it is no ≈ømall trouble to a wi≈øe and prudent per≈øon, as <hi>Corranus</hi> excellently expre≈ø≈øes it, to behold the mi≈øerable di≈øorders and confu≈øions of humane affairs. For how is it po≈ø≈øible to avoid it, nay how can a man chu≈øe but be filled with indignation, to ≈øee Ju≈øtice, Equity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, Fidelity, Integrity and Con≈øtancy, and all other ≈øuch like Vertues ≈ølighted and di≈øregarded by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and on the contrary, Inju≈øtice, Ba≈øene≈øs, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiou≈øne≈øs, Flattery, and ≈øuch like Vices, po≈ø≈øe≈øs the World, and carry all before them? Or what man can, without vexation, ob≈øerve the prepo≈øterous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind, which magnifies tho≈øe things, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46873:22"/>are not only vain but hurtful and pernicious; and not only contemn but hate tho≈øe things, which are truly good for them; nay, alone de≈øirable: No man can either be wi≈øe alone to him≈øelf, in ≈øuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Fools and mad men, without the greate≈øt grief and indignation: nor can be accommodate him≈øelf, with an equal mind, to the dotages of the common people; when he ≈øees that which is better.</p>

                        <p>The≈øe were the things he had ≈øugge≈øted in the Conclu≈øion of the former Chapter; and the beginning of this may have relation to every one of them.

                        <hi>Melancthon</hi> al≈øo hath an unu≈øual Interpretation; which is, that God made things ≈øo, that we ≈øhould ≈øweetly enjoy them (that he under≈øtands by <hi>placing the World in mans heart</hi>) but men make the u≈øe of them unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant, by their wandring de≈øires, by their vain ≈øolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46873:37"/>by their diffidence; which makes them long after new things, and meddle with that which is unnece≈ø≈øary. Like <hi>M.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46873:38"/>our own infirmities, to fear God, to obey his commands, to keep within the Bounds of our vocations, to beg and expect the help of God, and to acquie≈øce in his holy will and plea≈øure.</hi>

                        <hi>[g] V. 16.]</hi> Unto the≈øe things it is better for us to apply our ≈øelves, than it is to endeavour to be great and mighty (which is another vain de≈øire of man, fan≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he can thereby keep off many evils) for few can be at the top of all; and ≈øo there mu≈øt be ≈øtill greater than we, by whom we may be oppre≈ø≈øed: And our vexation will be ≈øo much the greater, when with all our power we cannot hinder it. As for tho≈øe that are in the very highe≈øt places (if they have not that fear of God before-≈øpoken of, v. <hi>14.</hi>) their power doth but betray them, to do the more mi≈øchief unto them≈øelves and others; and thereby encrea≈øe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery of Mankind. This ≈øeems to be the dependance between the foregoing Ver≈øes and this. Wherein the Wi≈øe man pa≈ø≈øes to the con≈øideration of the <hi>Third</hi> thing (mentioned upon Chap. I <hi>12.</hi>) unto which ≈øome a≈øpire, as the highe≈øt happine≈øs, <hi>viz. Greatne≈øs, Power,</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> Which if a man be bad, make him ≈øo much the wor≈øe him≈øelf, and the World by his means: and if he be good, will trouble him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, to find there are many abu≈øes, which by all his power he cannot remedy. For <hi>Solomon</hi> him≈øelf ≈øaw ≈øeveral gro≈øs impieties committed (as he tells us in this Ver≈øe) even by them who were appointed to be the Guardians of mens lives, liberties and enjoyments; which he, as great a King as he was, wanted ability wholly to redre≈øs: but ≈øtill they went on ≈øo confidently in their wicked cour≈øe of perverting Judgment, that he was fain to leave them to be judged by the ≈øupreme Judge of all, God Almighty. And if it were ≈øo, in the Reign of a good and wi≈øe King; what could be hoped for, in the Reign of tho≈øe who were impious and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46873:38"/>injudicious; as mo≈øt of the Kings of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> were? For ≈øuch pervert all things, by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetou≈øne≈øs, ambition or folly; ≈øo that their Subjects can have no Ju≈øtice, nor enjoy any tranquility. And be≈øides, they permit (as he ≈øhows afterwards, Chap. V.) many corruptions to creep into the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip; and ridiculous rather than religious Ceremonies to be introduced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon always follows a great decay of all moral Vertue.</p>
                     <p>In ≈øhort; this is a great part of the Vanity and mi≈øery, to which we are here ≈øubject; that, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> well notes, there are many things done unju≈øtly, even under ju≈øt Governours; becau≈øe they are not able to look unto all things them≈øelves, but mu≈øt manage them by other men: many of which are negligent, others wicked, and ≈øwayed by depraved affections; and yet crafty enough to cover their own guilt. Here is the only comfort, That <hi>God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding pre≈øerves Government, and Political Order;</hi> ‚òú and in his time will judge, even the Kings and Judges of the Earth.</p>

                        <hi>[h] V. 17.]</hi> The la≈øt words of this Ver≈øe, may, in my judgment, be thus mo≈øt literally tran≈ølated out of the Hebrew: <hi>There is a time for</hi> (judging) <hi>every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, and every work there,</hi> viz. in tho≈øe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Courts of Judgment: every thing that hath been tran≈øacted, in the Judicatures he had been ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>

                        <hi>[i] V. 18.]</hi> The≈øe words, which follow the former, are variou≈øly interpreted: but they have a per≈øpicuous ≈øen≈øe, if they be taken in coherence with the foregoing (as in rea≈øon they ought to be) without fan≈øying, as ≈øome have done, that they are ≈øpoken in the per≈øon of an <hi>Epicure.</hi> And ≈øo I have con≈øidered them; as intended to take down the vain opinion tho≈øe Great Men have of them≈øelves (which makes them tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their Inferiours) by repre≈øenting to them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46873:39"/>(or rather, de≈øiring God would effectually repre≈øent to their minds) how little they differ from Bea≈øts: ≈øave only in that, which they do not at all value, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <hi>viz.</hi> their immortal ≈øpirits.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Lebaram,</hi> to <hi>manife≈øt them,</hi> is commonly expounded of Gods manife≈øting them unto others; but I have taken it for his ≈øhowing them to them≈øelves; agreeable to the word that follows, <hi>Lireoth, that they might ≈øee,</hi> &amp;c. The whole may be thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølated ‚Äî<hi>that God would clear their minds, that they may ≈øee,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>[a] V. 1.]</hi> To prevent, or cure that folly mentioned in the <hi>Argument</hi> of the Chapter) he advi≈øes <hi>three</hi> things about the Wor≈øhip of God. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of them is in this Ver≈øe; to look to the di≈øpo≈øition of their mind, when they go to Gods Hou≈øe. And this pious di≈øpo≈øition of mind, con≈øi≈øts al≈øo in <hi>three</hi> things: <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> in frequenting the Hou≈øe of God, the place where He is wor≈øhipped: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a reverent behaviour there; ≈øuitable to the great thoughts we have of God, and to the humble ≈øen≈øe we have of our own meanne≈øs: expre≈ø≈øed, by <hi>keeping or ob≈øerving the feet,</hi> i. e. taking care to put off their Shooes, or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, as the manner was in tho≈øe Countries; and to go barefoot into the holy places; an≈øwerable to which now is, <hi>uncovering the head</hi> in our Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> well di≈øcour≈øes, in more places than one, Book II. p. <hi>441, 546.</hi> and then, <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> in a readine≈øs of the Will to obey all the Divine Precepts as the be≈øt of Sacrifices. For this is the Sacrifice of wi≈øe and good men; and all other Sacrifices without this, are but the Sacrifices of Fools and wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who are able, many times, to furni≈øh the Altar
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46873:50"/>with more Burnt-offerings, than the be≈øt of men. But they are ≈øuch Fools as not to con≈øider, that this very thing encrea≈øes their guilt; that they imagine God will be plea≈øed with the Sacrifice of Bea≈øts<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> without the Sacrifice of them≈øelves; in intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Will. So our Tran≈ølation ≈øeems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the la≈øt Clau≈øe of this Ver≈øe: which may be thus al≈øo tran≈ølated, <hi>For they make no con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do evil.</hi> It is no part of their Religion to ab≈øtain from wickedne≈øs: but fan≈øying by their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices they ≈øhall atone for that, they do not fear to commit it. To this purpo≈øe <hi>Maldonate</hi> expounds it, more plainly than any that I have read.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> Here he gives the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Advice; which is about Prayer, and about Vows to God, or (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ≈øeems to take it, and to which <hi>Melancthon</hi> wholly confines it) about the Doctrines we deliver concerning God: which ≈øhould be very well con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we affirm any thing of Him. The two first are mo≈øt proper to the place, e≈øpecially the latter of them: both which I have comprehended in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphra≈øe of this Ver≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> The rea≈øon for the foregoing Precept <hi>(of not u≈øing many words)</hi> taken from the con≈øideration of God's Greatne≈øs and our meanne≈øs (v. <hi>2.</hi>) together with the inforcement of it in this Ver≈øe, is thus explained by St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> He requires us, that whether we ≈øpeak or think of God, we ≈øhould not venture beyond our ability; but remember our imbecillity; and that, as far as the Heaven is di≈øtant from the Earth, ≈øo much do our thoughts fall ≈øhort of the excellence of his Nature. And therefore our words ought to be very moderate: for as a man<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that is full of thoughts, commonly dreams of tho≈øe things, whereof his head is full: ≈øo he that attempts to di≈øcour≈øe much of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, falls into folly. Or rather thus, Our words ought therefore to be few; becau≈øe even tho≈øe things,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46873:51"/>which we think we know, we ≈øee through a Gla≈øs, and <hi>in aenigmate;</hi> and we do but dream of that, which we fan≈øie we comprehend. So that when we have ≈øaid a great deal (and to the purpo≈øe, as it ≈øeems to us) the Conclu≈øion of our Di≈øputation is mere folly.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo much, we may be certain, he ≈øugge≈øts unto us, that in a multitude of words ≈øpoken unto God (as I rather under≈øtand it) there mu≈øt needs be many of them, as idle as mens thoughts are in a Dream. For the <hi>third</hi> Ver≈øe ≈øounds thus in the Hebrew, <hi>For a Dream proceeds from</hi> (or <hi>by</hi>) <hi>a multitude of toil≈øome bu≈øine≈øs; and the voice of a Fool from</hi> (or <hi>by</hi>) <hi>the multitude of words.</hi> That is, if a man have a multitude of cares in his mind, all the day, they will produce ≈øtrange, extravagant, or di≈øtracted Dreams in the Night: and, in like manner, if a man utter abundance of words, without con≈øideration and due weighing what he ≈øaith to God, many of them mu≈øt needs be fooli≈øh; whether they be Vows, or whether they be Prayers unto him (or whether they be Di≈øcour≈øes concerning Him; for we may refer it, if we plea≈øe, to all.) And the ≈øen≈øe will not much differ, if that Prepo≈øition, which we tran≈ølate <hi>from,</hi> be tran≈ølated <hi>with;</hi> in this manner, <hi>As Dreams come with a multitude of bu≈øine≈øs</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> bring before the mind, in a confu≈øed manner, what we have been doing, or thinking of, all day) <hi>≈øo a Fools voice comes with a multitude of words,</hi> i. e. he utters a great deal of incoherent, confu≈øed ≈øtuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus, the voice of a Fool comes <hi>in</hi> a multitude of words. And then the ≈øen≈øe will run thus: As a multitude of bu≈øine≈øs tires a man, and makes him but dream at la≈øt about it (and therefore he had better leave off, before he be unfit to attend it) ≈øo when a man enlarges him≈øelf too far in his Prayers or Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes of God) he doth but babble in a Conclu≈øion; and therefore had better be ≈øhorter.</p>

                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And now follows the <hi>third</hi> Advice, about the <hi>performing</hi> of Vows that have been <hi>made.</hi> Which is double; <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> not to delay the performance, nor put it off from time to time (which is the Subject of this Ver≈øe) le≈øt we be tempted, at la≈øt, not to perform our Vow at all; which is the <hi>≈øecond</hi> thing: of which he ≈øpeaks in the next words, ver. <hi>5.</hi> and <hi>6.</hi> where he cautions again≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øes, which men are apt to make for not being as good as their intentions. <hi>Greg.

For a Vow is an imperfect ≈øort of thing till it be made good: it hath only the beginning of a good thing, and wants its fini≈øhing; which if it have not, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ugly and odious. For God loves not (that is, hates) to be ≈øo dealt withall, as if He did either not under≈øtand, or not mind what we ≈øay to Him: or would put up that affront which the poore≈øt man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but re≈øent.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46873:52"/>as Dreams, there mu≈øt needs be much vanity; therefore have a greater reverence of God, than to ≈øpeak any thing ra≈øhly, or to make larger promi≈øes to Him, than thou art truly willing to make good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Hebrew the words run thus: <hi>But from a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Dreams</hi> (or <hi>when Dreams are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi>) <hi>both vanity and words are multiplied; therefore fear thou God.</hi> Which may have this meaning; they do but merely dream of God, and are not awakened to a lively ≈øen≈øe of Him; who make either tho≈øe vain excu≈øes, or tho≈øe idle promi≈øes: of which thou maye≈øt not be guilty, po≈ø≈øe≈øs thy ≈øoul with an awful dread of his Maje≈øty.

                     <p>Interpreters explain the words many other ways; whom the learned Reader may con≈øult: I have followed my own conjectures: And ≈øhall al≈øo propound another Tran≈ølation of the words, which ≈øeems to me very natural and ea≈øie; which is this: <hi>When, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Dreams, and vanities, and words, are multiplied; then fear thou God.</hi> That is, have a great care of thy ≈øelf, and let the dread of God overawe thee le≈øt thou offend, when thy head is hot and full of Dreams, and vain imaginations; which di≈øpo≈øe thee to ≈øpeak abundantly.</p>

And the la≈øt word of the Ver≈øe, will no way be ≈øo plain; as by referring it, both to the high per≈øon mentioned before, and to all his inferior Potentates and Judges; whom he ob≈øerves from on high; that is, from his Throne, or from his Seat of Judgment.

                     <p>It is an ob≈øcure Ver≈øe, both in its connection, and in ≈øome of its Phra≈øes: and therefore is diver≈øly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Interpreters.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46873:53"/>what went before. I have expre≈ø≈øed al≈øo both ≈øen≈øes of the la≈øt Clau≈øe, which we render, <hi>the King is ≈øerved by the Field;</hi> but may more literally be tran≈ølated, <hi>the King is a Servant</hi> (or is, <hi>addicted</hi>) <hi>to the Field.</hi> For anciently the greate≈øt per≈øons did not think it below them to follow Husbandry (who≈øe ju≈øt prai≈øes <hi>Cicero</hi> hath given in his <hi>Offices,</hi> but e≈øpecially in his Book <hi>de Senectute</hi>) as we are taught by the Examples of <hi>Hiero, Philometor, Attalus, Archelaus, Cyrus</hi> the younger in prophane Story; and by the Example of King <hi>Uzziah</hi> in Scripture, <hi>2 Chron. XXII. 10.</hi> Which did not at all abate their courage, or dull their Wits; but only made the one more patient of toil and labour, and the other more ≈øolid and more ≈øerious. Whence it is that we find the greate≈øt Captains among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ≈øuch as <hi>Camillus, Regulus, Fabius, Cato, Cincinnatus,</hi> were fetcht from the Plough: as <hi>Gideon</hi> among the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> was from the Thre≈øhing-floor; and <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> called to the high Office of a Prophet, as he was driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the twelve Ploughs, his Father had going in the Field.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Tran≈ølation of the≈øe words is not to be de≈øpi≈øed; who (and he alone, as far as I can find) thinks they are capable of being rendred thus: <hi>By following Husbandry diligently, a man may grow ≈øo rich as to become a King.

                        <hi>[f] V. 8. what hath]</hi> There is ≈øo great a difficulty in this Ver≈øe, that I did not know how to connect it with the foregoing; but by taking the latter part of the Sentence, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ≈øaid, <hi>What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon is there between him</hi> (viz the man before named) <hi>and the poor that knows how to walk before the living?</hi> i. e. the poor man who hath ≈øo much skill, as to know to live well, is infinitely to be preferred before him; who≈øe Wi≈ødom ≈øtill leaves him ≈øuch a Fool, that it doth not re≈øtrain his ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous appetites. And this ≈øuits well with the next words (v. <hi>9.</hi>) where the <hi>≈øight of the eyes,</hi> being oppo≈øed to the <hi>wandring of the de≈øire;</hi> it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable to take it for the fixedne≈øs of a mans mind, to re≈øt ≈øatisfied in what is before him: that is, in things pre≈øent.</p>
                     <p>Or the words may admit of this con≈øtruction (which is come into my mind, ≈øince I wrote the Paraphra≈øe) <hi>What excellence is there in the Wi≈øe man</hi> (that is, in the opinion of the wretch before-mentioned, there is none) <hi>more than in a Fool, e≈øpecially if he be poor,</hi> &amp;c. That is, to all other mi≈øeries of the≈øe rich Churls, this is commonly added, That they are very ignorant of what is mo≈øt truly valuable; having no e≈øteem of the wi≈øe≈øt man in the World, no more than a of a Fool. Nay, they prefer a rich Fool, before a poor Wi≈øe man: who knows how to carry him≈øelf ≈øo decently, that he is not afraid to appear before any man living. This is a great ≈øotti≈øhne≈øs (v. <hi>9.</hi>) and breeds no le≈øs ≈øorrow; to be led by blind Appetites, and not by Rea≈øon and Judgment. For ≈øo the first words of the <hi>ninth</hi> Ver≈øe, may be interpreted: <hi>Better it is to under≈øtand aright, than to follow after ones de≈øires.</hi>

                        <hi>[g] V. 10. That which hath been]</hi> The ≈øence that I have given of the beginning of this Ver≈øe (taking the fir≈øt word for an Interrogation, and <hi>name</hi> for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46873:59"/>renown, as is common in Scripture) ≈øeems to me to be the mo≈øt ≈øimple; and mo≈øt agreeable to the whole Di≈øcour≈øe. And it is that which <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath expre≈ø≈øed in the≈øe words, <hi>Although a man grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yet it is known that he is but a man; and he cannot contend with that, which is ≈øtronger than him≈øelf.</hi> That is, he cannot govern events. But I ≈øhall mention two other Interpretations, which ≈øome give of it. One is this, <hi>As he was made at fir≈øt, ≈øo his Name was given him;</hi> i. e. the Name of <hi>Adam,</hi> ≈øignifying that he was taken out of the Earth, and therefore mortal. The other is this; <hi>He that hath been, his Name is called already;</hi> that is, his memory is aboli≈øhed together with him≈øelf. This is <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s ≈øen≈øe; but is not agreeable to the Hebrew Phra≈øe, his <hi>Name is called;</hi> for that in the Scripture ≈øignifies rather the contrary, <hi>viz. fame,</hi> and honourable mention, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed it word for word out of the Hebrew, in the Paraphra≈øe. The common Interpretation may be found in all commentators, which is this; that <hi>God hath appointed what every man ≈øhall be; whether rich or poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore it is in vain for them to contrive, as they do, to be other than what they are:</hi> For it is to endeavour to alter that which is immutably ≈øettled by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 11. ≈øeeing there be]</hi> This Ver≈øe ≈øumms up all this matter about Riches; or, as others will have it, the whole foregoing Di≈øcour≈øe, concerning all tho≈øe <hi>four</hi> things, wherein men place their happine≈øs: wherether <hi>Wi≈ødom, Plea≈øure, Honour,</hi> or <hi>Wealth.</hi> Which draw ≈øo <hi>many,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>great</hi> (for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word includes both) inconveniences along with them; as ≈øufficiently demon≈øtrate a man is ≈øtill to ≈øeek for the ≈øatisfaction of his de≈øires, if he look no further.</p>

And ≈øo they would have the la≈øt Ver≈øe, to be an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the following Di≈øcour≈øe in the next Chapter: where he ≈øhows, wherein that true and ≈øolid happine≈øs lies, which Mankind vainly pur≈øue in the forenamed enjoyments.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a]</hi> Among all the Maxims of true Wi≈ødom and Piety, which are to be learnt, for the ≈øettlement of our mind in peace and tranquility, notwith≈øtanding the <hi>vanity</hi> that is in all things, <hi>Solomon</hi> recommends to us in the fir≈øt place; the care of that, which men fooli≈øhly lo≈øe; by minding nothing but heaping up Wealth, or plea≈øing them≈øelves in a voluptuous life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>to acquire a good Name.</hi> Which nothing but a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous u≈øe of all things, can be≈øtow upon us; and when we have it, will give us a ≈øingular delight at pre≈øent, and embalm our memory when we are laid in our Graves.</p>
                     <p>Which good Name (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> ob≈øerves) con≈øi≈øts in <hi>two</hi> things: in the approbation of our own Con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces judging aright; and in the approbation of other men, who al≈øo rightly judge. Both which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God; that we ≈øhould do right things, and that others ≈øhould approve of what is rightly done. Unto which they are bound, for <hi>two</hi> Rea≈øons; that the difference of Vertue and Vice may be made the more con≈øpicuous; and that others may be taught by Examples. He requires therefore that infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons be ca≈øt out of Society, and that they be honoured, who≈øe manners are without infamy. Now ≈øince ≈øuch approbation is a Divine Ordinance, it is manife≈øt we may de≈øire this Glory; and, by the ≈øame rea≈øon, that we must avoid all ≈øcandal, and take care that we may be commended.</p>
                     <p>Which <hi>Solomon</hi> here compares to a precious Ointment, becau≈øe nothing was more grateful and refre≈øhing in tho≈øe Eastern Countries: and therefore u≈øed not only in Fea≈øts, but at other times, when they were weary or langui≈øhing; for comforting the brain, recreating the ≈øpirits, chearing the countenance, ≈øuppling the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46873:66"/>joints; and for other ≈øervices tending to health, as well as plea≈øure. Which made Ointments to be held in the greate≈øt price and e≈øtimation; and to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among the Trea≈øures of Kings, <hi>2 King. XX. 12. XXXIX. I≈øai. 2.</hi> Suitable to this is that of <hi>Pindar, A Bath of warm Water doth not ≈øo refre≈øh the tired Bones, as Glory.</hi> And this of <hi>Thucidydes,</hi> that <hi>Honour is the nouri≈øhment and food of an old man;</hi> who lives upon the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he hath gotten by worthy Deeds, which will make Death not unwelcome to him. So the latter part of this Ver≈øe mu≈øt be under≈øtood, with reference to a well-≈øpent life; for otherways it would be only a di≈øcontented Saying, like that of the Heathen, <hi>The be≈øt thing is not to be born, the next be≈øt to die pre≈øently.</hi> Unto which Doctrine (as <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> well ≈øpeaks) the Church is a Stranger.</p>
                     <p>I cannot well pa≈øs over this Ver≈øe, without ob≈øerving, what all Interpreters note; an elegant <hi>Paranoma≈øia</hi> (as they call it) that is, a near affinity both in the Letters and in the ≈øound, of the≈øe two Hebrew words <hi>Schem</hi> Name, and <hi>Schemen</hi> Oil or Ointment: as there is afterward, <hi>v. 5, 6.</hi> between three other words, <hi>Shir</hi> a Song, <hi>Sirim</hi> Thorns, and <hi>Sir</hi> a Pot. Which being found al≈øo in ≈øeveral other parts of the Bible, it ≈øhows that ≈øuch allu≈øions are not un≈øeemly, nor ought to be cen≈øured as affectations; if they be ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly u≈øed, and wi≈øely, gravely and decently ≈øcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Di≈øcour≈øe; not ful≈øomely, upon every occa≈øion, obtruded.</p>
                     <p>[b]. <hi>V. 2.</hi>] Now the Wi≈øe man knowing that nothing ≈øtirs us up more powerfully to a religious life, than the frequent remembrance of our mortality (which alas! we are not willing to think of) he next advi≈øes him that would be happy, to embrace all occa≈øions that may put him in mind of it. The <hi>Meditation of Death,</hi> being as was anciently ≈øaid, <hi>the very Abridgment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46873:66"/>of all Philo≈øophy.</hi> All the Precepts of Wi≈ødom, they thought, were comprized in this; and therefore no wonder <hi>Solomon</hi> not only begins with it, but pre≈ø≈øes it ≈øo largely as he doth in the following Ver≈øes: to the end, that we may make our life not only a <hi>Meditation,</hi> but an <hi>Exerci≈øe</hi> of Death; which in the Chri≈øtian Language is called <hi>Mortification.</hi> In ≈øhort, the thoughts of Death will, without any other Teacher (if we keep it always in mind) in≈øtruct us in all tho≈øe Vertues, which will procure us a Good Name; ≈øome of which I have touched in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øe. And the more healthful we are, the more we had need to charge our ≈øelves with the thoughts of it; becau≈øe that is apt to make us forget it. So I have taken <hi>chai,</hi> not merely for <hi>living;</hi> but <hi>lively,</hi> vigorous, lu≈øty and flouri≈øhing, as we tran≈ølate it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>XXXVIII. P≈øal. 19.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> In the Explication of this Ver≈øe, I have touched upon another ≈øen≈øe of the fir≈øt word of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>: which ≈øignifies not only <hi>≈øorrow,</hi> but anger or indignation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo: by which ≈øome expound this Ver≈øe. And under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand thereby, either the anger of God afflicting men for ≈øin, or the angry reproofs that are given Sinners: which are better for them than pro≈øperity, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and humour them in their folly. But this is mentioned v. <hi>5.</hi> and therefore I take it not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here.</p>
                     <p>The truth of the latter part of this Ver≈øe is admirably explained by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>2 Corinth. VII. 11.</hi> As for the Phra≈øe I ≈øhall only note, that <hi>an ill look</hi> is an exact Tran≈ølation into our Language, of the Hebrew Phra≈øe, which is here tran≈ølated <hi>≈øadne≈øs of the countenance.</hi> Now a man may <hi>look ill</hi> not only by ≈øickne≈øs, but, by rea≈øon of any other thing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him (as we find in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Nehemiah, II. 2.</hi>) ≈øome of which I have expre≈ø≈øed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5. rebuke)</hi> The word includes <hi>roughne≈øs,</hi> and ≈øeverity in it; and is oppo≈øed to the ≈ømooth flatteries of tho≈øe, that ≈øeduce to ≈øin. So I have under≈øtood <hi>Song</hi> (not excluding the common ≈øen≈øe of the word, which I have al≈øo expre≈ø≈øed) for as the fir≈øt part of Wi≈ødom, is for a man to be able to give good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him≈øelf and others; and the next part of it, to take ≈øuch advice when it is given: So it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the fir≈øt part, to ≈øee a mans own faults and reprove him≈øelf for them; and to the <hi>≈øecond,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ≈øuch reproof willingly from others, and to abhor to be flattered and ≈øoothed, as if he had no faults at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> This compari≈øon between rebuke and flattery, <hi>Corranus</hi> thinks is continued al≈øo in this Ver≈øe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he paraphra≈øes in this manner; <hi>As Thorns put under a Pot, and kindled, make ≈øuch a crackling, as if they would ≈øet the whole hou≈øe on fire, and by their noi≈øe rai≈øe an expectation of the greate≈øt flame; but pre≈øently end in ≈ømoke and vapours: ≈øo ≈øen≈øele≈øs Flatterers make a great buzzing in mens ears, and blow up their minds, extolling them to Heaven with their Prai≈øes; but in truth make them not one whit the better,</hi> &amp;c. But I do not ≈øee how the word <hi>laughter</hi> can be well applied to this; and therefore I have omitted it, and only thought fit here to mention it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> The connection of this Ver≈øe with the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a little ob≈øcure; unle≈øs we tran≈ølate it, as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> doth (following <hi>Mun≈øter</hi>) <hi>A Wi≈øe man de≈øpi≈øeth calumny, and a mind that can be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Gifts:</hi> Which is an excellent Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well ≈øuited to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s purpo≈øe. But no Interpreters be≈øides them take the word <hi>jeholel</hi> in the ≈øignification of <hi>de≈øpi≈øing</hi> (except <hi>For≈øterus,</hi> who takes it for making one de≈øpi≈øed, tran≈ølating it thus, <hi>Calumny makes even a Wi≈øe man inglorious</hi>)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46873:67"/>but rather in the ≈øen≈øe of <hi>giving di≈øturbance,</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mad,</hi> as we tran≈ølate it. Though a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by <hi>O≈øchek</hi> (which rai≈øes this di≈øturbance in a Wi≈øe man) under≈øtand that ≈øort of oppre≈ø≈øion, which comes from calumny. Particularly <hi>Melancthon,</hi> herein follows the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> ≈øhowing what a mo≈øt pe≈øtilent mi≈øchief this is, in all Governments: whereby ≈øuch excellently de≈øerving per≈øons as <hi>Palamedes, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtides, Cimon,</hi> and <hi>Themi≈øtocles</hi> were oppre≈ø≈øed. The fountain of which Vice, is pride, envying the glory of others; and, that they may le≈ø≈øen it, mi≈øre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenting their coun≈øels and actions: Which ≈øophi≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal depravation of other mens words, and deeds, is called <hi>Calumny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I have not confined the ≈øen≈øe to this; the Hebrew word <hi>O≈øchek</hi> ≈øignifying all ≈øorts of oppre≈ø≈øions, as I have noted before, either by fraud or by force. And the ea≈øie≈øt ≈øen≈øe of the Ver≈øe ≈øeems to me, that which I have expre≈ø≈øed in the Paraphra≈øe; by connecting it with Ver. <hi>5.</hi> as a rea≈øon why we ought to hearken even to the rebukes of the Wi≈øe; that we may acquire a good habit of mind, able to hold out again≈øt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion on the one hand, and bribery on the other: which none can do, who is not very vertuous.</p>
                     <p>And in this Expo≈øition I have taken <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> doth; not for one that is <hi>perfect,</hi> but for a <hi>Proficient:</hi> who hath not yet ≈øettled wi≈øe Principles in his mind.</p>
                     <p>It is po≈ø≈øible al≈øo that <hi>Solomon</hi> may have re≈øpect to the oppre≈ø≈øions which men generally indure, in a State ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed. Which rai≈øes a just indignation, and holy warmth of zeal in the be≈øt of men: but if care be not taken to repre≈øs the violence of that perturbation, which this is apt to give us, it may turn into fury; and make us behave our ≈øelves towards our Superiors, as men out of their Wits.</p>

                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> I have connected this Ver≈øe with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; though it may be taken alone by it ≈øelf. And the word <hi>dabar,</hi> ≈øignifying either <hi>≈øpeech</hi> or thing, ≈øome (following the <hi>Vulgar</hi>) interpret this of the care that ought to be taken, in the <hi>Epilogue</hi> or clo≈øe of an Oration (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ≈øpeaks) rather than in the beginning or Preface to it; that, as we are wont to ≈øay, we may come off well, and leave a ≈øting in the minds of tho≈øe that hear it. But this is ≈øo wide from the Wi≈øe mans purpo≈øe, that I do not think fit to ≈øet down an excellent Di≈øcour≈øe of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ≈øen≈øe of the words, Lib. VIII. <hi>de Augm. Scient. Parab. 10.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we expound it of <hi>things,</hi> it is but a dilute ≈øen≈øe to ≈øay, that <hi>a thing perfected is better than a thing begun.</hi> Others therefore take it to be the ≈øame with that, <hi>Finis coronat Opus:</hi> which is true, but doth not complete the ≈øen≈øe; unle≈øs we under≈øtand it in this manner; that the <hi>Conclu≈øion of all things is to be expected, before we judge of them.</hi> For whil≈øt they are growing and coming on, they appear with a quite different face, from what they have, and when they are gone and ≈øhall be no more.</p>
                     <p>In the latter part of the Ver≈øe, <hi>patient in Spirit,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly one that is long before he grow angry, or fall into any pa≈ø≈øion; who is oppo≈øed to <hi>proud in ≈øpirit,</hi> becau≈øe it is <hi>high-mindedne≈øs</hi> (as the word ≈øignifies) which makes mens pa≈ø≈øion ri≈øe and ≈øwell ha≈øtily. It may have relation to the former part, and be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner: <hi>A patient man and ≈ølow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger di≈øpatches bu≈øine≈øs better, than a proud, huffing and blu≈øtering Spirit: who≈øe pa≈ø≈øion ≈øo di≈øorders his mind, and indi≈øpo≈øes it for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, that he ≈øeldom brings them to a good i≈ø≈øue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or thus, <hi>A proud man is a Boutefeau, who begins the fray: but the patient in ≈øpirit is the man that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46873:68"/>mu≈øt end it (if ever it be well ended) and that is much the better work, and the greater honour to him, who is employed in it, and effects it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, which is ≈øtill clearer, we ought to attend to the end of a thing with patience: becau≈øe it cannot be known what it will prove, nor whither it tends, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: and we ≈øhould be the more prone to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ≈øpirit, if we would expect the i≈ø≈øue of every thing. Thus <hi>Corranus</hi> paraphra≈øes upon the words mo≈øt excellently; but a little too long. <hi>It is no ≈ømall part of Wi≈ødom, to judge of things, and of bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs propo≈øed to us, ≈ølowly and maturely,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for we ≈øee frequently that incon≈øiderate men, finding a thing very hard and difficult in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and never thinking how profitable and plea≈øant the i≈ø≈øue may prove, immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpond; and out of an impatience, ≈øhall I ≈øay, or ra≈øhne≈øs of mind, de≈øi≈øt from the mo≈øt excellent Enterprizes; and many times betake them≈øelves to wor≈øe. From which ra≈øhne≈øs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy he will be very far removed, who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Divine Wi≈ødom, waits for the de≈øired and happy Conclu≈øion of his Affairs. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this nothing contributes more, than a ≈ølow, con≈øtant and patient mind, that can endure la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains: which ≈øtedfa≈øtly and quietly con≈øidering how fruitful the end may be which he affects, will not ≈øuffer him≈øelf by any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, trouble or wearine≈øs which he meets withal in the beginning, to be drawn from his purpo≈øe. Far different from tho≈øe, who out of a proud, arrogant humour, think it is ba≈øene≈øs, and unbecoming a gallant man, to attend upon the flow and lei≈øurely progre≈ø≈øes of things, and to expect their events.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he; which ≈øen≈øe I have not neglected in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øe; but comprized it, among the re≈øt; and it is

                     <p>But I think this advice, <hi>v. 10.</hi> is not merely to be re≈øtrained to this, but extended unto all ≈øorts of di≈øcontent, which are apt to make us complain of our pre≈øent condition; and ≈øo to admire what is pa≈øt, as not to mind what is pre≈øent: as if they had nothing but what was good, who lived before us; and we nothing but what is naught, in the≈øe days.

For our eyes ought not to be ≈øo fixed upon the pre≈øent calamities of our days, as blindly to overlook all the good: nor is the ancient felicity to be ≈øo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, as not to remember, that they al≈øo conflicted with many Tempe≈øts, and perhaps greater than we, as their frequent complaints of their times do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly te≈øtifie. He therefore that is wi≈øe and fears God, will make account (as the truth is) that it is in our own choice, by his Grace, whether the times ≈øhall be good or bad; for if he live well, they cannot be bad to him; as on the contrary, they cannot be good, if he live wickedly.</p>
                     <p>I am the longer in the≈øe Ob≈øervations, becau≈øe they are things of mighty moment: but mo≈øt of the re≈øt I ≈øhall contract, as much as is po≈ø≈øible.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46873:70"/>follows) that <hi>Wi≈ødom is equal to an Inheritance; nay, much to be preferred before it.</hi> For they may be thus tran≈ølated, <hi>Both Wi≈ødom and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance are profitable for men in this world; but e≈øpecially Wi≈ødom.</hi> Or, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> renders the la≈øt Clau≈øe, <hi>Et Re≈øiduum e≈øt videnti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Solem,</hi> and there is a remainder to tho≈øe that ≈øee the Sun.

                        <hi>[l] V. 12.]</hi> This is further explained in this Ver≈øe: Where it will be needle≈øs to do more than barely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that the word we render <hi>defence</hi> is <hi>≈øhadow</hi> in the Hebrew; which in their Language ≈øignifies protection, and comfort, <hi>XIX.

                        <hi>[m] V. 13, 14.]</hi> Here follows an admirable Advice, to comply with our pre≈øent condition, and ≈øuit our mind unto it: Becau≈øe we cannot bring things to the bent of our own mind, and therefore had better ≈øtudy to conform our mind to our condition, what≈øoever it be; whether pro≈øperity or adver≈øity. Into which the Divine Wi≈ødom hath divided our life, and ≈øo proportioned them one to the other; that none can ju≈øtly find fault with his Divine di≈øpo≈øal; nor, all things con≈øidered, tell how to mend them, and order them better.</p>
                     <p>So I have under≈øtood the la≈øt Clau≈øe of v. <hi>14.</hi> in which is the only difficulty: <hi>find nothing after him.</hi> Which Words <hi>(after him)</hi> ≈øome refer unto God, and make the ≈øen≈øe to be, that <hi>after Him</hi> (or be≈øide Him) <hi>a man ≈øhall find nothing certain:</hi> and therefore it is be≈øt to depend upon Him alone. Which I have not taken notice of in the Paraphra≈øe, and therefore mention here. Others refer <hi>after him</hi> unto
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46873:70"/>man; and that <hi>two</hi> ways (which it may be fit just to ≈øet down) Some tran≈ølate it thus, <hi>For this end, that man may find out none of tho≈øe things; which ≈øhall befall him hereafter:</hi> and ≈øo, being perfectly ignorant of what is to come, neither pre≈øume in pro≈øperity, nor de≈øpair in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity. Others thus (which is <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Glo≈øs) <hi>that man lo≈øing in time of adver≈øity, what he had gotten in pro≈øperity, might not adhere too much to the things of this World. Melancthon</hi> alone interprets <hi>find nothing,</hi> in this ≈øen≈øe, <hi>that he might not betake him≈øelf unto unallowed cour≈øes:</hi> but in pro≈øperity keep him≈øelf within the Bounds of his vocation, and not be carried beyond it by vain curio≈øity; and in adver≈øity expect the help of God, in the u≈øe of ≈øuch remedies as he hath ordained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 15.]</hi> This Ver≈øe may be either joined with the precedent, or with the following: I have connected it with both, in my Paraphra≈øe upon it, and v. <hi>16.</hi> where I have attended to the Scope of the Wi≈øe man in this Chapter; and accordingly interpreted that and the 17th. Ver≈øe; which will admit of ≈øeveral other Expo≈øitions.</p>
                     <p>They are commonly expounded of Publick Justice; which ought to be, neither too rigid, nor too remi≈øs and negligent. In≈øomuch that <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s words are, <hi>non dubium e≈øt;</hi> there is no doubt he ≈øpeaks of Political Justice, which governs the things of this life: and con≈øists in a mean, between cruelty and negligence. Too much ≈øeverity becomes cruelty; as it was in <hi>Aurelian:</hi> and too much indulgence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms men in wickedne≈øs, as it was in the days of <hi>Arcadius.</hi> A good Governour, like <hi>Augu≈øtus,</hi> takes a middle cour≈øe; and doth not ≈øeek that middle with too much ≈øubtilty: but rather, as in God, lets mercy prevail over judgment. The like admonition, ≈øaith he, is ≈øubjoined about Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46873:71"/>for, as too much ≈øeverity becomes cruelty, ≈øo too much Wi≈ødom, that is ≈øubtilty, becomes cavilling ≈øophi≈øtry, and cheating. And thus he interprets ver. <hi>17.</hi> that a Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould not tolerate enormous Vices.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> alone, as far as I have read, makes the 16th. Ver≈øe, <hi>Be not righteous over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,</hi> &amp;c. to be the Objection of a Wordling; who takes that for exce≈øs of Duty, which brings any damage, or worldly de≈øtruction upon him. Which is an≈øwered, ≈øaith he, in v. <hi>17. Be not wicked overmuch,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the fears, and from thence the prudential (but oftentimes very impious) practices of the Worldling, are the more probable Bath, to the mo≈øt ha≈øty ruines, <hi>Vid.</hi> An≈øw. to <hi>Cawdry,</hi> Chap. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not coherent, in my Opinion, with the re≈øt of the Chapter; and therefore I have followed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Opinion of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen:</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it of heat and zeal, more than needs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rea≈øon and di≈øcretion: Which, as it makes all the Schi≈øms in the World, ≈øo produces a great many other evils. And the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øion, ≈øaith he, is both about righteou≈øne≈øs, and about Wi≈ødom: <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>[a] V. 1.]</hi> To the advices he had given in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, he now adds ≈øome new ones; the fir≈øt of which is this; that <hi>the Wi≈ødom which will make us happy in this World, mu≈øt not make us moro≈øe and ≈øupercilious, ≈øevere and rigorous; but kind and benign, gentle and ea≈øie.</hi> And the more we know, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ought to be: and, by the very cheerfulne≈øs and plea≈øantne≈øs of our countenance, invite others to us; and not by our frowning, forbid them, or make them afraid to approach us.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be the meaning of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Ver≈øe; in my Paraphra≈øe upon which, I have had re≈øpect to ≈øeveral acceptations of the ≈øeveral Words, which it will be too long here to give an account of. They that will con≈øult Interpreters will find how they vary; and therefore I ≈øhall only mention the Expo≈øition of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> upon the latter part of the Ver≈øe (which is not commonly known) which following the LXX, he thus tran≈ølates: <hi>Wi≈ødom is the light of a mans countenance; but a pertinacious</hi> (or impudent, ob≈øtinate) <hi>per≈øon is worthy of hatred.</hi> Which he explains in this manner, that Wi≈ødom which can judge aright, when ≈øeverity is profitable, or when lenity will do be≈øt, when it is fit to make War, when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46873:78"/>to be quiet; brings a man great gladne≈øs; but a pertinacious per≈øon, who is ≈øtiff and ob≈øtinate in his Opinion; and will not hearken to tho≈øe that give him good coun≈øel, but follows the motions of his own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and obeys his pa≈ø≈øions, de≈øtroys him≈øelf and others. As the pertinacious humour, for in≈øtance, of <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Demon≈øthenes</hi> was mo≈øt pernicious unto all <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> This pertinacious humour ≈øhows it ≈øelf oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in oppo≈øing the Sovereign Authority: whereby men create to them≈øelves and others, great troubles in this World. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> advi≈øes men in the next place (de≈øiring them not to di≈ølike the coun≈øel becau≈øe a King gives it) to live in dutiful ≈øubjection to their Prince; as a ≈øingular means of leading a happy life. For it is hard to ≈øay, whether the Prudence and Ju≈øtice of a Sovereign, in ruling well; or the humble and peaceable ≈øpirit of the people in complying with the e≈øtabli≈øhed Orders; contribute most to the publick Welfare. Certain it is, that it is much ≈øafer and ea≈øier (as well as more honest) to ≈øubmit and be quiet, than to contend and un≈øettle the peace of Kingdoms; though Princes do not govern as they ought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancthon</hi> makes this Ver≈øe to contain two Precepts (as the LXX al≈øo ≈øeems to do) in this manner: <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the Commandment of the King; and the word of the Oath of God.</hi> A Sentence, ≈øaith he, exceeding worthy of con≈øideration and remembrance: in which he commands us to ob≈øerve the Command of the King; but with this re≈øtriction, that we ob≈øerve the Law of God, and do nothing contrary unto that. For he calls the Law the <hi>Oath of God;</hi> becau≈øe God made the Sanction of it, in promi≈øes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with an Oath. But this Interpretation wholly neglects one word in the Hebrew, <hi>viz. al:</hi> and it draws both <hi>dibrath</hi> and <hi>≈øhebuath Elohim</hi> from their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46873:79"/>ordinary and u≈øual ≈øen≈øe, to a meaning that is forced and strained. For which rea≈øon another Expo≈øition is not natural; which makes this indeed one Precept; but instead of taking the latter part of it for an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> to ob≈øerve it, turns it into a <hi>re≈øtriction</hi> of it; in this manner: <hi>Keep the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but according to the Oath of God;</hi> that is, as far as Religion and the Faith we owe to the great Lord of all will ≈øuffer.</p>
                     <p>This is true, but not the true ≈øen≈øe of the Hebrew word for <hi>Oath;</hi> which ≈øome would have relate to the Covenant made with God in Circumci≈øion; which is still further off from the bu≈øine≈øs than the Notion which <hi>Melancthon</hi> had of it. Our Tran≈ølation is the plainest and most literal; be obedient to the King, <hi>and that in regard</hi> (or becau≈øe of the matter) <hi>of the Oath,</hi> to which <hi>God</hi> is a Witne≈øs, and a ≈øevere Revenger of the breach of it. From which a modern Interpreter doth not much vary: who≈øe words it will not be unprofitable to ≈øet down in this place; which run thus in Engli≈øh. <hi>Regard the Kings mouth,</hi> i. e. Do what≈øoever comes out of his mouth; what≈øoever he commandeth and appointeth, out of that Authority which he hath by Divine Ordinance: <hi>and chiefly the intention of the Oath of God</hi> (≈øo he tran≈ølates the latter part of the Ver≈øe) "that is the Oath whereby every one citeth God as his Witne≈øs and Judge, that with a good Con≈øcience he will obey the King; becau≈øe God hath ≈øo commanded. Thus <hi>Joh. Coch.</hi> Which <hi>Oath</hi> is either <hi>tacit</hi> the very being in the condition of a Subject, carrying with it (as the late Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> ≈øpeaks) by implication, a <hi>≈øilent</hi> Oath of Fidelity and due Obedience) or <hi>expre≈øs,</hi> in the direct Form of an Oath, which Princes have, for their better ≈øecurity, been wont to exact of their Subjects.

                     <p>Some of the <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> were the fir≈øt that we read of, who would not take this Oath of Allegiance: but (as <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> tells us, L. XVII. Antiq.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46873:88"/>in that Phra≈øe, <hi>in the hand of God;</hi> wherein are included all the effects of his kindne≈øs and care) and that we mu≈øt not judge men to be good or bad, by what befals them in their outward e≈øtates.

Though this doth not ari≈øe merely from the ingratitude of the Prince, or the people alone; but there is added too oft to this the envy of the Nobility: who in ≈øecret repine at the event, though happy and pro≈øperous, becau≈øe it proceeded not from them≈øelves.

For a Fly is ob≈øerved to be both <hi>foedum &amp; foetidum Animalculum;</hi> e≈øpecially ≈øome ≈øort of them, which ≈øeem here to be particularly denoted by the Word <hi>Zebube:</hi> being not merely bred out of filth, and delighting to live in it, but leaving behind them ≈øuch a humour as is very offen≈øive to the ≈ømell, and kills tho≈øe Creatures into whom they thrust their ≈ønouts. From whence the God of the <hi>Ekronites</hi> had his Name of <hi>Baal zebub (2 Kings I. 2.)</hi> which if it were given him by his Wor≈øhippers, ≈øignified his power to de≈øtroy tho≈øe venomous Flies which infe≈øted the Inhabitants of that Country: if by the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> expre≈ø≈øed their contempt of him, as a mean, and a filthy, ≈øordid Idol. For therefore St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> compares the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to a <hi>Flie, VII. 18.</hi> not only becau≈øe they were a weak people, but <hi>propter ≈øordes Idololatriae,</hi> by rea≈øon of the ≈øordid filthine≈øs of their Idolatry: which was a great reproach to their famed Wi≈ødom: and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46873:98"/>made them vile, even in the opinion of Pagan people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> cannot here omit the reflection, which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made upon the≈øe words (L. VIII. <hi>de Augment. Scient.</hi> C. <hi>2.</hi> Parab. <hi>11.</hi>) <q>that the ca≈øe of men eminent for Vertue, is very hard, and mi≈øerable; becau≈øe their errours, though never ≈øo ≈ømall, are by no means pardoned. But as in a pure Diamond, of great lu≈øtre, the very lea≈øt ≈øpeck or ≈ømalle≈øt cloud ≈øtrikes the eye, and affects it with a kind of trouble; which in a gro≈ø≈øer Stone would ≈øcarce be ob≈øerved: ≈øo in men of ≈øingular abilities, the lea≈øt infirmities are pre≈øently e≈øpied, and become the matter of mens di≈øcour≈øe, and are per≈øtringed with a heavier cen≈øure; which in men of meaner parts or rank would either pa≈øs without notice, or ea≈øily procure pardon. <hi>Therefore a little folly in a very wi≈øe man, a ≈ømall ≈øin in a very hone≈øt man, and a ≈ølight indecency of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a man of courtly and elegant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, much derogates from their fame and reputation.</hi> So that it would not be the worst cour≈øe for excellent per≈øons, <hi>if they would min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ≈øome ab≈øurdities</hi> (≈øo it may be done without guilt) <hi>with their actions:</hi> that they may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a kind of liberty to them≈øelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Notes and Characters of ≈ømaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> From hence <hi>Solomon</hi> takes occa≈øion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent more largely, how much men ≈øuffer by their folly, and what advantages Wi≈ødom gives them: and treats of both, with re≈øpect, not only to mens private, but to the publick good. And <hi>fir≈øt</hi> he ≈øhows what a difference there is between a wi≈øe man and a Fool, in the management of any bu≈øine≈øs. So I have interpreted this Ver≈øe, which may be al≈øo thus paraphra≈øed, <hi>A Wi≈øe man always takes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46873:99"/>hone≈øt cour≈øes; but a Fool turns into bye ways.</hi> Thus <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> glo≈ø≈øes; <hi>A Wi≈øe man is his own Leader and Conducter to the be≈øt things; but a Fool inclines to the wrong ≈øide, nor will his folly ever lead him to any thing that is excellent.</hi> Which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> expre≈ø≈øes in this manner; <hi>A Wi≈øe man always thinks of the World to come, which leads to the right hand; but he that is a Fool, only of the pre≈øent World, which lies on the left.</hi> And quotes a famous Pa≈ø≈øage of <hi>Lactantius</hi> (which I find in his <hi>In≈øtitutions,</hi> L. VI. Cap. <hi>2.</hi>) concerning the Letter <hi>Y,</hi> unto which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> re≈øembled the cour≈øe of humane life. In which there is a time, when a Youth finds his way cleft, as that Letter is; into two parts or ways; and he ≈øtands doubting unto which he ≈øhould incline. If he be ≈øo wi≈øe as to take the right hand way, he is happy; if the other, he is mi≈øerable. Which ≈øen≈øe <hi>Grotius</hi> follows; <hi>the right hand is the way of Vertue; the left, the way of Vice.</hi> Unto which we may reduce that of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphra≈øt, The heart of the wi≈øe inclines to the Law of God, which was given from God's right hand; the Fool to Silver and Gold, which are the gifts of the left.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if this had been the ≈øen≈øe, it would have been more proper to have ≈øaid, the Wi≈øe mans heart is on <hi>the right hand;</hi> not on <hi>his</hi> right hand; which is much different: and therefore I have omitted this in the Paraphra≈øe (though I thought good to mention it here) and taken no notice of many other Glo≈ø≈øes; particularly that of <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s, which ≈øeems ≈øomething nearer to the ≈øen≈øe: <hi>The wi≈øe man hath power over his affections</hi> (the right hand being the ≈øtronge≈øt, and the in≈øtrument of action in most men) <hi>and can moderate them, as occa≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46873:99"/>but a Fool is under the Government of his pa≈ø≈øions; and is hurried that way, which his anger, ambition, grief, and other blind affections drive him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will add this that the meaning may be: <hi>A Wi≈øe man hath his Wi≈ødom always at hand;</hi> to direct him what to do, in publick or in private bu≈øine≈øs; whether he have to do with Friends or Enemies; in adver≈øity, as well as in a pro≈øperous e≈øtate (his mind being ju≈øt like the right hand, which we u≈øe readily, upon all occa≈øions, for all manner of actions) <hi>but a Fool is to ≈øeek;</hi> and knows not which way to turn him≈øelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is much to the ≈øame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, with what I have ≈øaid in the Paraphra≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> And agrees with what follows, in this Ver≈øe, the fir≈øt Words of which ≈øignifie as much as, <hi>Moreover,</hi> a Fool is ≈øo ≈øilly, that he cannot hide it. For though the re≈øt of the Di≈øea≈øes of the mind may be covered by artificial Di≈øcour≈øe, as the blemi≈øhes of our Bodies are with our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; only folly cannot be di≈ø≈øembled, but will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all, in every motion of him who≈øe weakne≈øs it is.</p>
                     <p>There is another ≈øen≈øe of the la≈øt Words of the Ver≈øe, be≈øide that in our Tran≈ølation; which I have not neglected: becau≈øe the Words will bear the ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> viz. <hi>He ≈øaith every Body is a Fool.</hi> Which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> interprets thus, <hi>He judges all men by him≈øelf. Symmachus</hi> thus, <hi>He fan≈øies him≈øelf the only Wi≈øe man.</hi> The LXX (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ob≈øerves) ≈øeem wide from the ≈øen≈øe, who tran≈ølate it thus: <hi>All that he thinks is very vain. Maldonate</hi> under≈øtands it differently from them all, in this manner: <hi>In that wherein he him≈øelf offends, he reprehends others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And then <hi>Solomon</hi> proceeds to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in≈øtance of this Folly and Wi≈ødom; e≈øpecially
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46873:100"/>in the Publick State and Government. Where it is great folly for a Governour to carry him≈øelf haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and furiou≈øly; but if he do, it is no le≈øs folly in his people to oppo≈øe him with the like pa≈ø≈øions; and not rather to be patient and peaceable: which is the ≈øen≈øe of v. <hi>4.</hi> Which ≈øome take for a Coun≈øel to Governours; others to the Subject. They that under≈øtand it as Coun≈øel to Governours, tran≈ølate it ≈øome of the≈øe ways: <hi>If the ≈øpirit of a Governour come upon thee,</hi> that is, if thou art fitted for Government, and advanced unto Dignity, behave thy ≈øelf humbly; and admini≈øter all things with great lenity: for that is the be≈øt way, to heal pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Di≈øtempers. Or thus, <hi>If thou art made a Prince, di≈øcharge this Office diligently,</hi> and with vigilance: for if thou art remi≈øs and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, it will make thee fall into great errours. Or, as ≈øome will have it, in this manner, <hi>Thou ha≈øt a de≈øire to be in authority, ≈øuppre≈øs it;</hi> or if it be offered thee, accept not of it: a private life is better; and le≈øs ≈øubject to the occa≈øions of ≈øin and danger. And ≈øome tran≈ølate it thus, <hi>If thou art in ≈øingular favour with the Governour, keep thy ≈øtation notwith≈øtanding; and be not ambitious of Preferment,</hi> &amp;c. Which is Coun≈øel unto Subjects; and by <hi>ruach (≈øpirit)</hi> of the Ruler, mo≈øt do not under≈øtand his <hi>favour,</hi> but his <hi>anger:</hi> and then al≈øo it may be taken in a different ≈øen≈øe from that in our Tran≈ølation (making it ≈øtill an Advice to him that is in Authority) that if anger come upon him, he ≈øhould reflect, and con≈øider the ≈øtation wherein he is; le≈øt this pa≈ø≈øion make him act undecently, and tran≈øport him into great ≈øins.</p>
                     <p>But the greate≈øt part of Interpreters, taking the Ver≈øe to be Coun≈øel to a Subject, in ca≈øe he incur the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure of his Prince, I have followed that ≈øen≈øe; which is almo≈øt agreeable to the coherence. And I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46873:100"/>have interpreted that Advice, <hi>not to leave his place,</hi> as mo≈øt do, for not quitting the Duty of a Subject: but have taken in al≈øo the mo≈øt ingenious Interpretation of the Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi> Who makes this a Political Advice to Courtiers; not to relinqui≈øh their Place and Office, nor to retire from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Charge, as many do when they ≈øee their Prince angry with them. <q>Which ari≈øes part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of an <hi>impatience of di≈øgrace;</hi> partly le≈øt they ≈øhould <hi>make the wound bleed afre≈øh,</hi> by coming into the pre≈øence; partly that their Prince may ≈øee <hi>how ≈øorrowful, and humble</hi> they are: which makes them think fit to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from their employments; nay, to re≈øign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Offices and Dignities them≈øelves into the Princes hands.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But <hi>Solomon</hi> di≈øallows this way of Cure, as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prejudicial; and that upon very good grounds. For <hi>fir≈øt</hi> this cour≈øe, doth <hi>too much publi≈øh the di≈øgrace it ≈øelf:</hi> from whence both Enemies and Enviers grow more bold to hurt; and Friends more timorous to help. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By this means it comes to pa≈øs, that <hi>the wrath of the Prince,</hi> which, if it had not been made publick, would have died perhaps of it ≈øelf, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes now more fixt:</hi> and having begun to overthrow the man, is carried on to his utter ruine. And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> this retiring <hi>≈øavours ≈øomething of a malignant humour;</hi> that is fallen out with the times: which heaps the mi≈øchief of indignation, upon the mi≈øchief of ≈øu≈øpicion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The proper Precepts therefore for a Cure, are the≈øe; which he thinks are contained in the la≈øt Words, <hi>Pliant demeanour pacifies great offences.

But though I take this to be the true ≈øen≈øe; yet I ≈øhall here mention ≈øome others, that the Reader may chu≈øe which he thinks mo≈øt congruous.

And therefore they, the more they are u≈øed, give them that employ them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labour; but this; the more it is exerci≈øed, gives us the le≈øs: Thus <hi>Maldonate.</hi> Some in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, If iron be blunt, it mu≈øt be ≈øharpned; and ≈øo must the Sword of Justice (when by the negligence of Officers, it hath lo≈øt its edge, and the Earth is filled with violence, with thefts and adulteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be re≈øumed and whetted by the Magistrate, to the ≈øevere puni≈øhment of ≈øuch wickedne≈øs.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[I] V. 11.]</hi> In the Expo≈øition of this al≈øo there is much variety; according as the Hebrew Phra≈øe <hi>Ma≈øter of the tongue,</hi> is expounded, either of a <hi>mere Babler,</hi> and loo≈øe Talker; or of a <hi>Backbiter</hi> and Slanderer. I have taken it in the latter ≈øen≈øe; as St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the Vulgar Edition, doth. And the former part of the Ver≈øe, may either ≈øignifie a Serpent that <hi>is</hi> not inchanted; or that <hi>cannot be</hi> inchanted, by any means. For ≈øome ≈øuch ≈øort of Serpents there were, as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> ob≈øerves (L. <hi>3. de ≈øacr. Animal.</hi> C. <hi>6.</hi> Part. II.) and as appears out of <hi>Jer. VIII. 17.</hi> and other places of holy Scripture. Unto which, I think, the Backbiter and Detracter may be be≈øt compared: for nothing will re≈øtrain his virulent humour: nor defend one from the mi≈øchief which he doth in ≈øecret. I have connected this Ver≈øe al≈øo with the precedent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as it may be, though we ≈øhould take the Words in the common ≈øen≈øe: which is this; that as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will bite, if he be not charmed; ≈øo will he do mi≈øchief that talks much, if he govern not his tongue with great Wi≈ødom. Or, as others interpret the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Ver≈øe, a mans words though never ≈øo eloquent (for ≈øo the Word <hi>lacha≈øch</hi> is u≈øed, <hi>III.

                     <p>Others take this Ver≈øe ≈øeparate from the re≈øt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand no more by it, than this; that a Calumniator is like a Serpent, that bites ≈øecretly; without ≈øo much as giving warning by its hi≈ø≈øing. So <hi>Melancthon;</hi> who truly ob≈øerves, that calumny is a mo≈øt grievous Pe≈øtilence; which rages and de≈øtroys whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46873:104"/>For it fir≈øt kindles Di≈ø≈øentions; and thence ari≈øe Confu≈øion of Religion, Wars and De≈øolations. Or, according to our Tran≈ølation. <hi>A Babler can no more refrain from blurting out his own or others Secrets, than a Serpent, if he be not charmed, can do from biting.</hi> Which may be referred al≈øo to the matter foregoing, in this manner: He that gives him≈øelf a liberty of talking of every thing, blurts out even the Secrets, and the Vices of Princes; whereby he not only makes him≈øelf odious, but procures his own destruction.</p>

There would be le≈øs harm in folly, ≈øaith he, if it would be content with its own ru≈øtick ignorance: but it affects to contradict the dictates of Wi≈ødom, and to affront prudent per≈øons; nay to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and overthrow them; whereby it becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wicked.</p>
                     <p>

But the ungodly begin their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, chiefly in the contempt of Magi≈øtrates; when they bear how God blames and reproves them in the holy Scriptures. But it belongs to the Divine Office to find fault with Magi≈øtrates and to rebuke them. And therefore, though thou heare≈øt it, yet do not imitate it. For thou art not God; nor the Ordainer, no nor the Reformer and Re≈øtorer of the Divine Ordinance.

And if thou ≈øhould≈øt ≈øu≈øtain their Office, would≈øt offend more than they

The meaning therefore of <hi>Solomon</hi> is this; I have ≈øpoken much of Princes, how they undo the World; but do thou reverence them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that; for they are not an humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but a Divine.

Why then wilt thou ≈øpeak evil of tho≈øe, who are vexed with ≈øo many and ≈øuch great cares and labours for thy peace<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> if they be good? and if they be bad and fooli≈øh, their own impiety is mi≈øchief enough to them, and brings them into ≈øufficient danger.

                        <p>As Obedience to Governours, and patience under ill Government are the means (he ≈øhows in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters) to pre≈øerve peace and quietne≈øs; which are the great ble≈ø≈øings of humane life: ≈øo in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, quiet and ea≈øie times nothing contributes more to our happy living, than the constant exerci≈øe of <hi>Charity,</hi> in Works of Mercy; which make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved both of God and man. Upon which therefore the Wi≈øe man here in≈øists largely; in the <hi>≈øix</hi> first Ver≈øes of this Chapter: and then pre≈ø≈øes men to it by the con≈øideration, that there is no plea≈øure like this, while they live; and that as they cannot keep what they have long, but Death will rob them of all: ≈øo they must give an account of what they have enjoyed; and therefore had best make ≈øuch an u≈øe of it, as will stand them in stead at that time.

                        <hi>[a] Ver≈øe 1.] Charity</hi> being the Subject of his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe in the fir≈øt <hi>≈øix</hi> Ver≈øes of this Chapter (as was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46873:111"/>ob≈øerved in the <hi>Argument</hi>) he begins with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of it: tho≈øe who, as our Saviour ≈øpeaks <hi>(XIV. Luke 14.)</hi> are not likely to recompence us again. Thus this fir≈øt Ver≈øe (about which there are various conceits) I think may be mo≈øt naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And it is a very ancient Expo≈øition, as appears by the Words of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus;</hi> which are the≈øe in Engli≈øh: <hi>It is ju≈øt to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent it may ≈øeem to be lo≈øt, (and thrown away, as we ≈øpeak) like the bread that is ca≈øt upon the water; yet, in proce≈øs of time thy love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will appear not to be unprofitable and without fruit.</hi> And after the ≈øame manner <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> in after-times (Orat. XIX. pag. <hi>298.</hi>) ≈øpeaking of the liberality of his Father to the Poor; ≈øaith, He proceeded upon this Maxim: That it is much better, for the ≈øake of tho≈øe who may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to give to tho≈øe who are unworthy, than for fear of be≈øtowing our Charity upon the unworthy, let worthy people want it. To which that ≈øeems (≈øaith he) to belong, which we read in <hi>Solomon [Ca≈øt thy bread upon the water] Which is not thrown away and quite lo≈øt, in the account of him that ju≈øtly e≈øtimates things; but is ≈øent thither where all that we do is laid up; and ≈øhall in due ≈øea≈øon meet us again, though we think not of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, to ≈øtrengthen this, it is ob≈øerved by ≈øome, that <hi>water,</hi> in Scripture ≈øignifie, great affliction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery, <hi>XVIII. P≈øal. 17. LXVI. 12.</hi> And therefore the ≈øen≈øe of the Proverb is not, of ≈øowing in a fertile Ground, by the Rivers; or in a Soil well watered, from whence men naturally expect a fruitful Crop (as ≈øome expound it) but of ≈øowing (i. e. giving alms) there, from whence we expect no fruit; no more than if we threw the Seed in a rapid River;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46873:112"/>in which it is carried away, no body knows whither, and ≈øeems utterly lo≈øt.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo it may be applied al≈øo to ungrateful people; as I have touched in the Paraphra≈øe: and I ≈øhall not trouble the Reader with other Expo≈øitions, which may be found in mo≈øt Commentators; only naming this of <hi>Maldonate</hi> (which agrees well enough with that which I have followed) <hi>give to the poor, who≈øe mi≈øeries are ≈øo great that their faces are all wet and be≈ømeared with tears.</hi> And though there be many of them, be not ≈øparing, if thou art able to receive them; for <hi>waters</hi> ≈øignifie ≈øometime a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, in the Scripture Language. But that's the ≈øen≈øe of the next Ver≈øe; and therefore upon the <hi>face of the waters,</hi> is as much as upon tho≈øe, <hi>who will be gone pre≈øently,</hi> like the Waters of a River; and never bring any thing back to us, to reward us: if they do, is more than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                     <p>As for the Word <hi>Bread</hi> it ≈øignifies any benefit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poor may be ≈øupported: e≈øpecially all ≈øorts of Food (<hi>1 Sam. XIV. 24.</hi> where it comprehends <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and every thing that was edible) more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that Food which is made of Corn, <hi>III. Gen. 19.</hi> and from thence ≈øignifies <hi>Corn</hi> it ≈øelf, of which Bread is made, <hi>XXVIII. I≈øai. 28.</hi> And ≈øo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> here expounds it; agreeable to what I ≈øaid above, of ≈øowing ≈øeed in the Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> And as in the fir≈øt Ver≈øe he hath re≈øpect to the <hi>quality</hi> of the per≈øons, unto whom we are to give; ≈øo here to the <hi>number</hi> of them, and the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of our Alms: which is expected perhaps by a great multitude. Yet let not that damp it (≈øaith he) out of a fancy that it will undo us, to relieve them all: but, if we be able, let us help them; and though more ≈øtill come when we have extended our Charity according to our utmo≈øt ability, let us rather go beyond
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46873:112"/>it (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Chri≈øtians did, <hi>2 Cor. VIII. 3.</hi>) than let mi≈øerable Creatures peri≈øh. Thus <hi>Greg.

I will only note, that here again <hi>Solomon</hi> contradicts the Vulgar Principle upon which covetous Wretches move; and directs the quite contrary. They think all is lo≈øt, that is given away in Charity: no ≈øuch matter, ≈øaith the Preacher (v. <hi>1.</hi>) the fruit of it will be found hereafter, beyond what can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. O, ≈øaith the covetous man again, I know not what will be hereafter: now I have enough, but in the latter end of my life I may want; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is be≈øt to ≈øave whil≈øt I may. No, ≈øaith the Preacher, for that very rea≈øon, give; becau≈øe thou knowe≈øt not what may be hereafter; when that may be taken away from thee, which now thou wilt not be≈øtow upon needy people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> In this Ver≈øe, he illu≈øtrates both the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>rea≈øon</hi> of it. The former by the <hi>Clouds,</hi> which are a fit Emblem of Charity: the ≈øecond, by the <hi>Trees;</hi> which can bring forth Fruit no longer
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46873:113"/>than they continue joined to their Root; from which being ≈øeparated, they bear no more, nor can be fixed to their Root, as the Clouds may be filled with Water, again. So I have interpreted the latter part of this Ver≈øe: which <hi>Grotius</hi> under≈øtands as if it meant no more than the foregoing: <hi>Do good to men without di≈øtinction; like him who, when he cuts down a Tree, regards not which way it falls.</hi> I omit other Interpretations, and ≈øhall only mention <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Glo≈øs upon this Ver≈øe, which is ingenious enough. He urges us, ≈øaith he, to do good, while, we live, by two Rea≈øons. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> From the <hi>profit of it,</hi> becau≈øe we ≈øhall receive more than we give; like the Clouds, which receive from the Earth but a thin Vapour; which they return to it in mo≈øt copious Showres. The <hi>≈øecond,</hi> From the <hi>impo≈ø≈øibility</hi> of being in a capacity to do good when we are dead; for then, like a Tree, we mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as we are when Death ≈øeizes us<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and never be re≈øtored to our former condition again. <hi>Corranus</hi> alone (as far as I can find) expounds the latter part thus, in his Annotations: <hi>A Tree in what place ≈øoever it is planted, there abides, and brings forth Fruit: and ≈øo ought we to help others by all manner of means: in what≈øoever place or time we live.</hi> And he takes <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> for all Parts of the World. If any think fit to apply this, unto the unalterable condition wherein we mu≈øt remain in the other World (like a Tree cut down, which if it fall toward the North, cannot change its po≈øiture, and turn to the South) they cannot follow a fitter Glo≈øs upon the Words, than this of <hi>Luther</hi>'s. <hi>If the Lord find thee in the South; that is, fruitful and rich in good works, it will be well: but if in the North; that is, barren, of good works, it will be ill with thee. How≈øoever thou art found, ≈øo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46873:113"/>thou ≈øhalt be judged; and ≈øo thou ≈øhalt likewi≈øe receive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And then follows here an Admonition to take the fir≈øt opportunity of doing good; and not to deferr it becau≈øe now it may ≈øeem un≈øea≈øonable, and we fan≈øie it may do better another time. Which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> extends unto all other things, as well as Alms. <hi>There is no greater, or more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent impediment of action</hi> (≈øaith be, in the Conclu≈øion of the Fir≈øt Chapter of the VIIIth. Book of <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) <hi>than an over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ob≈øervation of decency; and of that other Ceremony, attending on it, which is too ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous election of time and opportunity. For</hi> Solomon <hi>≈øaith excellently, He that ob≈øerveth the Wind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We mu≈øt make opportunity, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than find it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus that great Prince <hi>Xerxes</hi> (otherwi≈øe not very prudent, ≈øpeaks very di≈øcreetly in <hi>Herodotus</hi> (L.VII.) <hi>Be not fearful of all things; nor con≈øider eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing minutely: for if in the con≈øidertion of bu≈øine≈øs, thou wilt weigh every thing alike, thou ≈øhalt never be able to do any thing.</hi> And thus <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> under≈øtands this place, <hi>As events are not in our power</hi> (which he takes to be the meaning of v. <hi>3.</hi>) <hi>≈øo he that will have certain and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed events</hi> (that is, ≈øuch and ≈øuch things come to pa≈øs) <hi>before he act, will never attempt any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ≈øo a great Divine of our own expounds it; <q>If we will ≈øu≈øpend our re≈øolution, till we can bethink our ≈øelves, of ≈øomething free from all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; in mo≈øt of our deliberations, we ≈øhall never re≈øolve upon any thing at all: God having ≈øo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered things, that every commodity hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiou≈øne≈øs, every conveniency ≈øome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience attending it; which many times, all the

                     <p>Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> al≈øo elegantly accommodates the≈øe Words to negligent Pa≈øtors; who will not preach, but when the people are very de≈øirous to hear; and there is a fair Gale breathing to favour their de≈øign.

                     <p>Or, as ≈øome under≈øtand him, his meaning is, <hi>Now you have ≈øeen, wherein happine≈øs doth not, and wherein it doth con≈øi≈øt; therefore do not either imagine there is none at all here in this World, or that it is greater than really it is: But take a middle cour≈øe, which I have ≈øhown you, and look upon this life as having plea≈øure in it, but not ab≈øolutely perfect; yet ≈øuch as our condition will permit; begun here, and to be completed in another World.</hi>

                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> The beginning of this Ver≈øe I have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Hebrew, where the Words run thus, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> him≈øelf tran≈ølates them, <hi>If a man live many years, let him rejoyce in all the≈øe things,</hi> &amp;c. And the latter part of the Ver≈øe, I have ≈øuppo≈øed, contains two Motives to moderation in our pre≈øent enjoyments, and to make us think of doing ≈øome good with them, as the highe≈øt plea≈øure of all. Becau≈øe they will have an end, when we can no longer enjoy them; and becau≈øe, while we have them, they run away apace, as all that follows will do; and leave us empty and di≈ø≈øatisfied, unle≈øs we have made a good u≈øe of them: upon which we may reflect, when they are gone, with ≈øome plea≈øure.</p>

                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46873:115"/>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> To tho≈øe Motives, he here adds the mo≈øt con≈øiderable thing of all: which is expounded <hi>two</hi> ways by Interpreters. Some taking the≈øe Words as a <hi>permi≈ø≈øion,</hi> under ≈øuch re≈øtraints as he mentions in the end of the Ver≈øe: others, as <hi>ironically</hi> and <hi>≈øarca≈øtically</hi> (as the Greek Phra≈øe is ≈øpoken; by way of mockage, and bitter ≈øcoff. The two <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Phra≈øes (<hi>rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>let thy heart cheer thee</hi>) incline to the former way; being commonly u≈øed in a good ≈øen≈øe: the two <hi>la≈øt (walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ≈øight of thy eyes)</hi> unto the other way, being commonly u≈øed in a bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ≈øcope of the place, and the coherence mu≈øt determine it. And as the LXX and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> go the first way; ≈øo it agrees best, in my opinion, with what went before; and therefore ≈øo I have paraphra≈øed it. And con≈øidering that they are two different Words in the beginning of the Ver≈øe, which we tran≈ølate as if they were the ≈øame (viz. <hi>young man,</hi> and <hi>youth</hi>) I have not done ami≈øs, I think but expre≈ø≈øed them more ≈øignificantly, by the≈øe Words, <hi>childi≈øh youth.</hi> And ≈øo they are distingui≈øhed in the last Ver≈øe; where that Word which here we tran≈ølate <hi>youth,</hi> we more truly tran≈ølate <hi>childhood:</hi> which goes before youth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> Here I have followed the judgment of St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> who under <hi>anger</hi> (or <hi>grief</hi>) comprehends all the perturbations of the mind: and under <hi>evil of the fle≈øh,</hi> all the hurtful plea≈øures of the Body. And accordingly I have expounded the whole Ver≈øe, with re≈øpect to the danger Youth is in, by the fiery motions of both ≈øorts: the former of which incline men to imitate the Wild Bea≈øts; the other ≈øink them, into the condition of the dullest Brutes.</p>
                     <p>The word we here tran≈ølate <hi>youth</hi> ≈øignifies the <hi>peep of day,</hi> in our Language; the <hi>appearing of the morning:</hi> and therefore is to be understood of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46873:115"/>upon the most plea≈øant time of our life. Which, as well as <hi>childhood,</hi> is but <hi>vanity;</hi> that is, pre≈øently vani≈øhes (as ≈øome will have it) and will be ≈øoon gone: or rather, Childhood and Youth, ≈øignifying all that is done in that Age of our life; the meaning is, it is an Age of great levity, folly and indi≈øcretion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, as <hi>Luther</hi> ob≈øerves, the great care of mankind ≈øhould be to ≈øea≈øon <hi>Youth</hi> with right Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and a good ≈øen≈øe of things; and then it is not to be denied all plea≈øures, of which it is very de≈øirous; much le≈øs ≈øhut up from the very ≈øight of them, for it abbhors ≈øolitude. And this is to begin at the wrong end of Education; which mu≈øt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied fir≈øt to the mind, not to the Body: And when the Mind is well tinctured, the Body will be ea≈øily governed. That is, neither follow filthy plea≈øures; nor be carried away with furious pa≈ø≈øions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The benefit of which will be un≈øpeakable; for they that live plea≈øantly and quietly in Youth, are likely to arrive at and enjoy a comfortable Old Age.</p>

                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> The≈øe infirmities he demon≈øtrates to be very great, becau≈øe decrepit Age con≈øi≈øts in the univer≈øal decay of the whole frame of Nature: Which I take to be the meaning of the <hi>Sun, the light, the Moon and Stars,</hi> being darkned. For as in a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the extinction or falling down of the≈øe ≈øignifies, in the Prophetical Language, the ≈øubver≈øion of that frame of Government (as, to omit abundance of other places, may be ≈øeen in what <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> ≈øaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Egypt, XXXII. 7, 8.</hi>) ≈øo the darkning of the≈øe in the Natural Body of man, ≈øignifies, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its total decay and nearne≈øs to a di≈ø≈øolution: the tumbling (as we ≈øpeak) of an Old Man into his Grave; like a ruinous old hou≈øe which can ≈øtand no longer; for ≈øo the Metaphor is carried on, v. <hi>3.</hi> And then the <hi>return of Clouds after the Rain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the di≈ømal condition a man is in at that time: when one trouble treads upon the heels of another: which is no ≈øooner gone, but the like, or a new one, comes in its room. And ≈øo the Words may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølated, <hi>The Clouds return, and after that the Rain:</hi> that is, there is a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of mi≈øery, of grief, pain, or weakne≈øs, drawing on one another. There are ≈øome who apply the darkning of <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> to the mind of man (as one would think, indeed, he ≈øhould ≈øay ≈øomething of that; and all the following de≈øcription belonging wholly to the Body, we mu≈øt find it here or not at all) but ≈øtill I conceive that he intends only in general, to ≈øignifie the failing of the mind in all its faculties and powers; without a re≈øpect to ≈øome particular di≈øtinct faculty in each of the≈øe Words. But they who think the inward
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46873:121"/>powers are here intended, are not content to re≈øt in ≈øuch a general meaning; but will have ≈øomething in particular ≈øignified, by every one of them. And then they do but gue≈øs, which gives me the liberty to interpo≈øe my conjectures al≈øo: that by the <hi>Sun</hi> may be meant the Soul it ≈øelf; by the <hi>Light,</hi> its Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding; by the <hi>Moon,</hi> the Will; by the <hi>Stars,</hi> all the Nations in the Mind and Memory, with all the affections and pa≈ø≈øions in the Will: ju≈øt as <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> in <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi>'s Dream, ≈øignified his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Brethren.</hi> And ≈øo the ≈øen≈øe of this Ver≈øe is, the Mind of man grows feeble in all its powers; the Under≈øtanding dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øighted, the Memory forgetful; the Rea≈øon weak and childi≈øh (giving ≈øuch a feeble light, that it can neither direct our ≈øelves nor others) the Will li≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs in all its de≈øires, dull about our greate≈øt concerns, wavering and incon≈øtant in all its re≈øolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I judge it more rea≈øonable, as I ≈øaid, to re≈øt in the Interpretation fir≈øt mentioned (which I am ≈øure is agreeable to the holy Language in other places) that hereby is only repre≈øented in general, the univer≈øal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the faculties of the upper part of man, his Soul. Which ≈øen≈øe I have comprehended together with the other in my Paraphra≈øe: and not neglected this, in which others acquie≈øce, that the≈øe Words ≈øignifie <hi>the mi≈øeries an Old man feels, both night and day.</hi> As for tho≈øe who hereby under≈øtand the dimne≈øs of the eyes, it being expre≈ø≈øed afterward, v. <hi>3.</hi> I have taken no notice of their ≈øen≈øe: But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is, which is worth mentioning. For the meaning may be, <hi>There is nothing but darkne≈øs:</hi> i. e. a mo≈øt uncomfortable condition; like that, when the Heavens are clouded day and night (as they were in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage, <hi>XXVII.

                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> As in the foregoing Ver≈øe he gave a general de≈øcription of the decay of the whole Body (and of the internal faculties of the mind together therewith) ≈øo here he enters into the Particulars. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Body to be like an Hou≈øe or Tabernacle (unto which it is frequently compared, not only in the Scripture, but all other Authors) he re≈øembles the Shoulders, Arms and Hands, to the <hi>Keepers of the Hou≈øe:</hi> becau≈øe by them we defend our ≈øelves from dangers; admini≈øter both Food and Phy≈øick; exerci≈øe all manner of Arts and Manufactures (as we call them) as long as they have any ≈øtrength remaining in them. Which Old Age takes away, the Nerves, Tendons and Ligaments ≈øo flagging, that the≈øe <hi>Keepers</hi> quiver and ≈øhake (<hi>tremble</hi> we render it) and grow ≈øo u≈øele≈øs that we can no way help our ≈øelves or others with them.</p>
                     <p>And then he compares the Thighs, Legs and Feet, to <hi>≈øtrong men:</hi> they being the Supporters and Pillars, as it were, of the whole Fabrick, which hold it up; till Old Age quite di≈øables them for this Office, and makes the Knees <hi>bend,</hi> under the burden of the Body alone.</p>
                     <p>The Rea≈øon of which follows; in that the <hi>Grinders fail,</hi> &amp;c. in which Metaphor he compares the <hi>Teeth</hi> in the Jaws above and below, to the upper and nether Mill-≈øtone.

                     <p>And the like decay we find in the ≈øight of the eyes; which he means by <hi>tho≈øe that look out of the Windows.</hi> All tho≈øe <hi>Coats, Humours, and Nerves,</hi> that make up the eyes: which are ≈øet in

There is no nece≈ø≈øity, I acknowledge, of interpreting this Pa≈ø≈øage thus (though it ≈øeem mo≈øt agreeable to the re≈øt of the de≈øcription) becau≈øe it may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølated, <hi>the daughters of a ≈øong:</hi> that is ≈øinging women, <hi>are not valued at all,</hi> by old men: They account them nothing worth; and would not give, as we ≈øay, a Farthing for them.

For as their heads turn giddy, if they a≈øcend to any high place, ≈øo they tremble in the plain way; for fear of a Stone, a Clod, an Hole, any unevenne≈øs, by the ri≈øing or depre≈ø≈øion of the Earth (for ≈øo <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks the Words may be expounded, though the antient Interpreters do not favour it, <hi>He is afraid to ≈øtumble at the ri≈øing or falling of the Earth</hi>) or he fears he may be pu≈øht down by others, if he do not fall of him≈øelf; in a word, he knows not what he may meet withal, and therefore fears.</p>
                     <p>Or it may be expounded, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> takes it, <hi>He never thinks him≈øelf ≈øafe, though he be in an high Fortre≈øs.</hi> Or, dreads an high Wall, though never ≈øo firm; le≈øt it ≈øhould fall upon him.

                     <p>And this would agree well with the next Words, <hi>the Gra≈øhopper ≈øhall be a burden:</hi> Which ≈øeem to be a de≈øcription of his ≈øtooping under the burden of Old
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46873:124"/>Age; his Shoulders, Hips and Back all bunching out; which is a load great enough for him, without any other. In ≈øhort <hi>he can ≈øcarce bear him≈øelf,</hi> as <hi>Melancthon</hi> expounds it: Which <hi>Avenarius</hi> thinks is a literal Tran≈ølation of the Words, the <hi>Gra≈øhopper</hi> or <hi>Locu≈øt ≈øhall burthen it ≈øelf;</hi> that is, ≈øaith he, his <hi>gibbous back.</hi> Which is better than their Glo≈øs, who make it to ≈øignifie, he can ≈øcarce bear the weight of a Gra≈øhopper or Locu≈øt. The LXX tran≈ølate it, <hi>the Locu≈øt ≈øhall be made fat;</hi> i. e. e. ≈øwell, bunch out, or be burthen≈øome: Which aptly denotes the <hi>knotting of the Joints</hi> (like tho≈øe of the Locu≈øt) and the ri≈øing up of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> (or any ≈øuch thing in the Body of man) which make his back re≈øemble that of a Locu≈øt. And ≈øo <hi>Jo. For≈øterus</hi> excellently tran≈ølates it, <hi>ut in curvo incedat dor≈øo, ≈øicut cicada,</hi> that he goes crooked in the back, like a Gra≈øhopper. <hi>Luther</hi> al≈øo had this in his mind (though he did not fully explain it) when he thus glo≈ø≈øed upon the≈øe Words: <hi>Such an Old man is like a Locu≈øt: for his Bones ≈øtick out, and his Body is ≈øhrunk up; ≈øo that he is a mere Image of Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then the next ≈øignifies no more than this, That the greate≈øt bodily plea≈øures fail; and the member that ≈øerves tho≈øe plea≈øures is relaxed and flaggs. For the Word <hi>haavijonah</hi> (which we tran≈ølate <hi>de≈øire</hi>) ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies either the <hi>Fruit</hi> of a Shrub, which the LXX take to be <hi>Capers</hi> (though <hi>avionoth</hi> ≈øignifie the Berries of Laurels, Myrtles, and indeed of all the le≈ø≈øer ≈øort of Trees) or that <hi>de≈øire</hi> which it is ≈øuppo≈øed (according to <hi>Avicenna</hi>) to excite; or that <hi>Knob</hi> in us, which ≈øomething re≈øembles that Fruit.</p>
                     <p>There is one Interpretation of the≈øe <hi>three</hi> la≈øt Clau≈øes which ≈øeems to me not at all con≈øtrained, but apt enough (only it doth not make them all relate to the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46873:125"/>parts of the Body, as the re≈øt do) which is that of <hi>de Dieu;</hi> from whom <hi>Junius</hi> before him did not much differ. It is this, <hi>Though the Almond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree flouri≈øh, and the Locu≈øt be loadened with fat</hi> (i. e. though the plea≈øures of the Spring appear and come on apace, making all things el≈øe to ≈øwell with joy) <hi>it doth not invigorate his blood, nor make it ri≈øe, to ≈øtir up his de≈øire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The rea≈øon is, he is ju≈øt upon the point of leaving all things here, and going to his <hi>long home.</hi> Which ≈øignifies either the place to which all men go (<hi>domum ≈øeculi,</hi> the hou≈øe of the whole World, whether all mankind have ever gone, and mu≈øt go) or the place from whence he came; as <hi>For≈øterus</hi> expounds <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ≈øeculi ≈øui,</hi> his old hou≈øe, out of which he fir≈øt came forth (thus we tran≈ølate the Word <hi>olam, VI. Jer. 16.</hi>) or that where they mu≈øt long abide, even till the re≈øurrection of the dead.</p>
                     <p>For their Friends there leave them; and can do nothing more, but mourn for them: as it follows here, <hi>The Mourners go about the Streets.</hi> That is, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the Funeral; ready to accompany the Her≈øe: or, they already bewail him, as a dead Corps rather than a living man; or, when he is dead, can only give him a ≈øolemn Funeral, and openly bewail him; not only at home, but in the Streets. For which purpo≈øe they ≈øometimes hired Mourning-men, and Women; who are the <hi>Min≈øtrels</hi> we read of, <hi>IX. Matth. 23.</hi> For <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> ≈øaith (L. III.

                        <hi>&amp;c. there were many Min≈øtrels hired at</hi> Jeru≈øalem, who began to make lamentations in a doleful tone. But <hi>Gierus</hi> in his Treati≈øe of the <hi>mourning of the Hebrews</hi> (p. <hi>320.</hi>) thinks <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not here mean the mourning of tho≈øe that accompanied the Corps to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46873:125"/>Grave, nor their walking about in mourning Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but the ≈øad lamentations, which their grief ≈øometimes moved them to make, in the very Streets: when they were weary with mourning at home, or put thereby into an extravagant pa≈ø≈øion; like that which the Jews ≈øuppo≈øed <hi>Mary</hi> the Si≈øter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to fall into, when ≈øhe ro≈øe up ha≈øtily and went out of the hou≈øe, <hi>XI.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> Now we are come to the mo≈øt difficult Ver≈øe of all; in which the Wi≈øe man de≈øcribes this hou≈øe as falling down: that is, enumerates the evils, which immediately forego Death; of which he would have us think frequently, while the hou≈øe is in good condition: For tho≈øe Words <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks are here again to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>or ever,</hi> that is, before Death ≈øeize on thee, and pull down this earthly Tabernacle and lay it in the du≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>by loo≈øning the ≈øilver cord.</hi> Which ≈øome fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie ≈øignifies all the <hi>humours of the Body;</hi> which are, as it were, <hi>the Thred of life;</hi> which the De≈øtinies were ≈øaid to ≈øpin out, for a certain time, and then cut off: Others under≈øtand by it, <hi>the ≈øtring of the tongue:</hi> and <hi>Ga≈øpar Sanctius</hi> (upon <hi>VII.

But the be≈øt of the Hebrew Writers by this Cord under≈øtand the <hi>Spinal Marrow</hi> (that is, the Pith of the Back-bone) others the <hi>Nerves;</hi> others the outward <hi>Coats</hi> of the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is little rea≈øon to doubt, but the Marrow down the Back, continued from the Brain, as it were, in a String or Cord, unto the very bottom of it; together with the Nerves ari≈øing from it; and the Filaments, Fibers and Tendons that proceed from them, are the thing here intended. Which <hi>Melancthon</hi> ≈øaw long
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46873:126"/>ago; <hi>the Nerves,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>and Ligaments are here meant;</hi> which have literally the power of <hi>Cords,</hi> both to unite and tie together, and al≈øo draw.

                        </gap>) who hath al≈øo ≈øolved that doubt, why they are expre≈ø≈øed in the Singular Number: becau≈øe, though there be many of them; yet, they are the continuation of one and the ≈øame thing (the <hi>Fibers</hi> being nothing el≈øe, but the Nerves divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øper≈øed; and the <hi>Nerves</hi> nothing el≈øe but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in like manner ≈øeparated, as ≈øo many Arms and Branches of the ≈øame Tree) they are all one in their <hi>Original,</hi> the Brain; they are all one in their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation,</hi> for a long ≈øpace in the Spine; all one in their <hi>u≈øe,</hi> to convey the Animal Spirits, and to be the In≈øtruments of motion.</p>
                     <p>This Cord is called <hi>Silver,</hi> becau≈øe of its colour; being not only white, but al≈øo ≈øhinning bright and re≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and that when it is taken out of the Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. I omit other Rea≈øons.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>loo≈øned</hi> (≈øhrunk up, or contracted, or removed as others tran≈ølate it) when it is no longer full of Spirits: and ≈øo the Body becomes void of ≈øen≈øe and motion, either in part or in whole.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond ≈øtep to a di≈ø≈øolution, is by breaking <hi>the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bowl:</hi> and as the former related to the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, as one may ≈øay, of ≈øen≈øe and motion; ≈øo this to the Fountain: <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, and all contained in it: The Membranes, for in≈øtance, e≈øpecially that which the Ancients, from the great e≈øteem and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they had for it, call <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Which is that part which deeply in≈øinuating it ≈øelf, into all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractuous pa≈ø≈øages of the Brain (as Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> ≈øpeaks) and being firmly annexed thereunto; keeps every part thereof in its proper place, and due texture: ≈øo that what≈øoever is performed within the whole compa≈øs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46873:126"/>of the Brain (whether the making Animal Spirits, their exerci≈øe therein, or their di≈øtribution therefrom) is principally done by the help of this Membrane. Which therefore may well be called <hi>gullath;</hi> that part of the Head which is the <hi>Spring</hi> of all the motion that comes from thence. And ≈øo we tran≈ølate the Plural of this Word, <hi>XV. Jo≈øh. 19.</hi> and both <hi>For≈øterus</hi> and <hi>Avenarius</hi> under≈øtand the Singular here.</p>
                     <p>And it is called <hi>golden</hi> Bowl (like that <hi>IV. Zachar. 2, 3.</hi> from whence the Oil was conveyed by Pipes unto the Lamps) for ≈øuch Rea≈øons as gave the other the name of <hi>≈øilver</hi> Cord. For in≈øtance, in re≈øpect of the colour; not only becau≈øe that mo≈øt precious and deep-coloured Liquor of life, is abundantly contained in the Ve≈ø≈øels of this Membrance; but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Membrane it ≈øelf is ≈øomewhat of a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh colour; and tends more towards that of Gold, than any other part what≈øoever doth. But e≈øpecially, in re≈øpect of its excellency and univer≈øal u≈øe: for it being the in≈øtrument that doth depurate the be≈øt of Blood, clarifies and exalts the Vital Spirits, and ≈øo prepares them for animality (as they ≈øpeak) to what ≈øhould it be likened, but to that mo≈øt perfect, be≈øt-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and mo≈øt exalted Mineral of Gold?</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>breaking</hi> of this Bowl is its lo≈øing its u≈øe; not being able to retain its Liquors (as a Bowl is u≈øele≈øs when it is broken) or as Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> explains it; in the extremity of extreme Old Age, it can no longer continue its continuity; but by rea≈øon either of its natural dryne≈øs, ≈øhriveling into it ≈øelf, or of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural moi≈øture, imbibing excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, till it be over-full; it oft-times ≈ønaps a≈øunder, and ≈øo recurrs (<hi>i. e.</hi> runs back, as the Hebrew Word ≈øignifies) into it ≈øelf; from whence the Brain mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øub≈øide, and all the Part ≈øerving unto Animal motion be ≈øuddenly and irrecoverably da≈øht
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46873:127"/>in pieces. So <hi>Avenarius</hi> judiciou≈øly tran≈ølates this Pa≈ø≈øage, <hi>That yellow Membrane which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Brain, be trodden down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third ≈øtep is, the <hi>breaking of the Pitcher at the Fountain.</hi> Which is variou≈øly interpreted; ≈øome; under≈øtanding hereby, the inability of the Bladder to retain the Urine; others by <hi>Fountain</hi> under≈øtand the <hi>Liver,</hi> and by the <hi>Pitcher,</hi> the Bladder of Gall; or the Veins; which is the mo≈øt common Opinion. But Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> rather takes it for the <hi>heart:</hi> which is indeed the <hi>Fountain of Life;</hi> and hath two di≈øtinct Cavities, the <hi>right</hi> and the <hi>left:</hi> out of which proceed tho≈øe <hi>Veins</hi> and tho≈øe <hi>Arteries;</hi> which carry the Blood through the whole Body, and bring it back again to the heart, in a perpetual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                     <p>And if by <hi>Pitcher</hi> we under≈øtand the Veins, which are the <hi>receptacle</hi> of the Blood (and the Hebrew Word ≈øignifies any <hi>containing Ve≈ø≈øel,</hi> particularly the Widows <hi>Barrel</hi> in which was her Meal, <hi>1 King. XVII. 14, 16.</hi> as well as a <hi>Barrel of Water</hi> in the next Chapter <hi>XVIII. 33.</hi>) then by the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> mu≈øt be peculiarly under≈øtood the <hi>right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of the heart; which is the Original from whence the Veins have their ri≈øe. For ≈øo the Hebrew Word ≈øignifies, not only a <hi>Fountain,</hi> but a <hi>Spring;</hi> from which Waters bubble up and bur≈øt forth (as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølate it, <hi>XXXV. I≈øai. 7. XLIX. 10.</hi>) in a running Stream: and therefore is ≈øo to be tran≈ølated here, the <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Original,</hi> viz. of the Veins, which proceed from thence. Which induced Commentators to take the <hi>Fountain</hi> here for the Liver: which they would not have done, had they under≈øtood, as we do now, that the Veins do not ari≈øe from thence, as their fir≈øt Original; but from the right Ventricle of the Heart. And they are ≈øpoken of in the Singular Number (as the Nerves were before) becau≈øe they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46873:127"/>are all of one and the ≈øame nature, original and u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>breaking</hi> of this Pitcher into ≈øhivers (as the Hebrew Word ≈øignifies) is the utter failing of the Veins; their cea≈øing quite from their natural action and u≈øe. When they can no longer carry back, nor conveniently convey unto the heart that Liquor, which they properly contain: but the little Blood which remains in the cold Body of man, near his end is congealed, and ≈øtagnates in his Veins.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo I proceed to the la≈øt thing, <hi>the Wheel broken at the Ci≈øtern.</hi> Where by the <hi>Wheel</hi> ≈øome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the <hi>Lungs;</hi> which, by their continual motion, do thru≈øt out the Breath from them, and draw it in again to them: re≈øembling the <hi>Wheel of a Well,</hi> now drawing up the Bucket to it ≈øelf; anon letting it down again into the Well. <hi>Melancthon,</hi> by <hi>Ci≈øtern</hi> under≈øtanding the <hi>Stomach</hi> (the Word ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, ≈øaith he, a profound Cavity) takes the <hi>Wheel</hi> for the <hi>Guts</hi> adjoining thereunto: which are wrapt about one another, in a kind of Circular form; and make the <hi>Me≈øentery</hi> look like a Wheel. Which <hi>Grotius</hi> ≈øeems al≈øo to have had in his mind. But, taking it for granted that a <hi>Wheel,</hi> being an In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circulation, is the Hieroglyphick of ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that goes, and makes, a round in us, I think Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s conjecture is mo≈øt probable; that hereby is meant the great Artery, with all its Branches: which is the great in≈øtrument of rotation or circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Body of man; and ≈øo evidently thru≈øts the Blood forward, that we perceive its Pul≈øes, forcing the Blood along its Cavity, in the Wri≈øts, the Temples, and other Parts of the Body. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which In≈øtrument to compel it, the Blood that naturally tends home to the heart, would go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:46873:128"/>
And then the <hi>Ci≈øtern</hi> from whence this Wheel forces the Liquor, and conveys it through all the Parts, is the <hi>left Ventricle of the Heart:</hi> to which this great Artery is annexed, and from whence it ari≈øeth. For a <hi>Ci≈øtern</hi> is a Ve≈ø≈øel made on purpo≈øe to receive a due proportion of Water, and to keep it till the time of u≈øe; and then conveniently to pa≈øs it into Ve≈ø≈øels that are prepared to receive it from thence. And ≈øuch is the left Ventricle of the Heart; which in its <hi>Dia≈øtole,</hi> as they call it, receives the Blood that is brought into it from the Lungs: and then, keeping it there a little, doth in its <hi>Sy≈øtole</hi> pa≈øs due proportions thereof, into the great Artery, to be di≈øpen≈øed as was ≈øaid before. And, for this end, there are little <hi>Valves</hi> or Falling doors placed, at the entrance and at the going out of this Ci≈øtern; which are like Cocks to let in, and to let out; and, by their opening or ≈øhutting, give convenient pa≈ø≈øage, or ≈øtoppage to the Liquor; which continually runs that way.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo the <hi>breaking</hi> or <hi>≈øhaking in pieces</hi> (as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterus</hi> tran≈ølates the Word) of this Wheel, is the cea≈øing of the Pul≈øe ≈øo he in another place tran≈ølates it, <hi>trodden down,</hi> i. e. <hi>≈øuppre≈ø≈øed</hi> by the decay of the in≈øtruments of Pul≈øations; which can no longer perform that work. Which being ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the pre≈øervation of life, the cea≈øing of it is death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> And ≈øo the <hi>Body,</hi> made of a mouldering ≈øub≈øtance, being no longer a fit habitation for the Spirit (and therefore de≈øerted by it) which held the parts of it together, ≈øhall crumble again into the Earth, out of which it originally came: according to that Sentence pa≈ø≈øed upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Du≈øt thou art and unto du≈øt ≈øhalt thou return, III. Gen. 19.</hi> This Body was no better in its fir≈øt Principles: and though now we are very fond of it, as if it were ≈øome goodly thing; yet, when
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46873:128"/>the Spirit leaves it, it will appear to be indeed but <hi>Du≈øt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the nobler part of man, being of an higher Original, ≈øhall return to God, who ≈øent it into the Body; to be di≈øpo≈øed of by Him, according to the Sentence that he ≈øhould pa≈øs upon it. For the <hi>Chaldee Paraphra≈øe</hi>'s Explication of the latter part of this Ver≈øe is very appo≈øite, <hi>It ≈øhall return, that it may ≈øtand in judgment before God.</hi> For <hi>Elohim</hi> (the Word here for <hi>God</hi>) in the Hebrew Language ≈øignifies a <hi>Judge.</hi> As in the place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <hi>1 Sam.

Which he prepares the Reader to attend unto, and receive into his mind; fir≈øt, by a≈ø≈øerting his own great Authority in this Ver≈øe (who the wi≈øer he was, the more de≈øirous he was both to teach, and to learn) And then, the weighty Doctrine which he taught, v. <hi>10.</hi> And the great u≈øefulne≈øs of it, v. <hi>11.</hi> The like to which they would find no where el≈øe, v. <hi>12.</hi> It is not very material which of the≈øe ways we take; but I have had re≈øpect to both, in my Paraphra≈øe: where I have expre≈ø≈øed the ≈øen≈øe ≈øo fully, that I cannot think fit to enlarge any further upon this Ver≈øe. But only note, that <hi>Luther,</hi> and he alone I think, expounds the fir≈øt Words thus (not ab≈øurdly, nor di≈øagreeing with the Hebrew Text) <hi>There remained nothing to the Preacher, but that he was wi≈øe,</hi> &amp;c. He under≈øtood and taught aright, and took a great deal of pains; which was a great ≈øatisfaction to him≈øelf) but he ≈øaw little or no ≈øucce≈øs of it in others, who would not be governed by his Advice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> This Ver≈øe runs thus, word for word, in the Hebrew, <hi>The Preacher carefully ≈øought to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46873:129"/>meet with de≈øirable words; and the writing of uprightne≈øs; and the words of truth.</hi> Where <hi>writing</hi> may refer both to what he read in others, whether Divine or Humane Authors; and to what he wrote him≈øelf (and ≈øo I have expounded it in the Paraphra≈øe) which he commends from three Heads, <hi>plea≈øure,</hi> or delight; <hi>u≈øefulne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>certainty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some fan≈øie that <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote a Book called <hi>Catub Ja≈øcher</hi> (the Writing of Uprightne≈øs) or <hi>Ja≈øcher dibre emeth</hi> (the upright Words of Truth) of which, as there is no certainty, ≈øo I ≈øee no probable grounds to a≈ø≈øert it. Only we know he wrote a great many more Books than we have, <hi>1 King. IV. 32, 33. 2 Chron. XXXV. 4.</hi> And ≈øee <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> L. VIII. Antiq. C. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> Some connect this with the foregoing Ver≈øe in this manner, <hi>The Preacher ≈øought to find out the words of the Wi≈øe,</hi> &amp;c. And ≈øo the Words run exactly in the Hebrew. But we may take this Ver≈øe by it ≈øelf, ≈øupplying the Word <hi>are,</hi> as we do in our Tran≈ølation; and look upon it as a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the≈øe wi≈øe Words: which doth not in the lea≈øt alter the ≈øen≈øe. I have had re≈øpect to both; and comprehended al≈øo, in my Paraphra≈øe, two of the Interpretations, which one difficult Phra≈øe is capable of, viz. <hi>Ma≈øters of the A≈ø≈øemblies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which may be tran≈ølated divers ways, more literally out of the Hebrew than we do; who add the Word <hi>by</hi> before them, which is not in the Original. For the la≈øt Words, which we tran≈ølate <hi>Ma≈øters of A≈ø≈øemblies,</hi> may be attributed to <hi>Nails,</hi> in this manner: <hi>As Nails fa≈øtened, whereby things are joined together,</hi> (<hi>Nails</hi> being the In≈øtruments of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or bringing tho≈øe things together, which were ≈øeparate) or thus, retaining the Words of our Tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>the Ma≈øters of A≈ø≈øemblies are as fixed Nails:</hi> or the <hi>Ma≈øters of Collections,</hi> ≈øuch judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46873:130"/>Authors as make excellent Collections of Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms and ≈ømart Sayings, <hi>Stick in the Mind as Nails do in Planks.</hi> Or the <hi>Principal,</hi> the choice <hi>Collections</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of Wi≈øe men, mentioned in the beginning of the Ver≈øe) <hi>are as,</hi> &amp;c. or it may, in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, be connected (not with Nails, but) with the Words following: the <hi>Ma≈øters</hi> or <hi>Authors that collect wi≈øe and pithy Sayings, have their Gifts from one and the ≈øame Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So ungrounded is the fancy of <hi>Grotius;</hi> who from hence conjectures, that there were ≈øeveral per≈øons appointed by <hi>Zerobbabel</hi> (whom he takes for this <hi>one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtor</hi>) to collect the Sentences of this Book, and put them out under the name of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Who him≈øelf may rather be thought to be this <hi>one Pa≈øtor</hi> or <hi>King:</hi> who employed (if we interpret the Words this way) many per≈øons to make Collections: of which he afterwards made u≈øe as he ≈øaw cau≈øe.</p>
                     <p>This ≈øeems to be certain, that he here gives the rea≈øon of this conci≈øe and ≈øententious way of Writing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øuch acute Sayings, not only ≈øtir up and quicken ≈ølothful minds for the pre≈øent (as a Goad ≈øtimulates the dull Oxe to labour) but penetrate deep and ≈øtick fa≈øt in the memory; collecting al≈øo the thoughts, affections and re≈øolutions, to one certain Point or Scope; and gathering together a great deal of ≈øen≈øe into a few Words. As tho≈øe Words <hi>baale a ≈øyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poth,</hi> Ma≈øters of A≈ø≈øemblies, or Authors of Collections may, I have ≈øometimes thought, be under≈øtood. Such a Collector was that Great Man <hi>Julius Cae≈øar;</hi> who gathered a Book of Apoththegms; and ≈øhowed by that, he thought it more honourable unto him, if he changed him≈øelf, as it were, into <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicils,</hi> in which the prudent and grave Sayings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were regi≈øtred; than to have his own Words hallowed like Oracles, as ≈øome vain Princes, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46873:130"/>by flattery, have affected. Though divers of his own Speeches, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ob≈øerves (L. I. <hi>de Augm. Scient.</hi> C. <hi>7.</hi>) are truly ≈øuch as tho≈øe which <hi>Solomon</hi> here de≈øcribes, full of vigour and efficacy: in≈øomuch, that by one word alone he appea≈øed a mutiny in his Army.</p>
                     <p>But, after all that may be ≈øaid on this Subject, ≈øince I find not only the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> but the LXX making out the ≈øen≈øe by adding the Word <hi>per</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> And in this Ver≈øe have adhered to the ≈øame Tran≈ølation, which under≈øtands the fir≈øt Words, as if he had ≈øaid: Beyond the≈øe things do not trouble thy ≈øelf. For ≈øo they may be tran≈ølated exactly, <hi>and what is above, or more than them</hi> (that is, the <hi>the words of the wi≈øe,</hi> beforementioned) <hi>my Son, be warned, or be enlightned:</hi> ob≈øerve the≈øe well, and trouble thy ≈øelf no further. Be content with a few good Precepts of the Wi≈øe; and do not involve thy ≈øelf in many Books. For what is nece≈ø≈øary may be learnt without much labour, out of a ≈øhort Book: if men will be wi≈øer than they need they will but trouble them≈øelves to no purpo≈øe. There being no certainty of mo≈øt things; no ≈øatisfaction when we go beyond the known and acknowledged Principle, and Precepts of Vertue: but what one man a≈ø≈øerts, another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes; and when we think we have written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, another Writer ≈øtarts up and di≈øcovers abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of errours; and ≈øo Volumes are multiplied without end: and we are led into long di≈øqui≈øitions, without any ≈øatisfaction to the mind, but with much wearine≈øs to the Body, and great lo≈øs of precious time; which had better be ≈øpent in dige≈øting and practi≈øing, ≈øuch ≈øhort, u≈øeful, and nece≈ø≈øary In≈øtructions as the≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:46873:131"/>
He doth not ab≈øolutely condemn many Books, for there are not a few of the Divine Writings; and about the ≈øame thing: but Books about needle≈øs things; and that dilate too much upon things nece≈ø≈øary; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tiring, than in≈øtructing. And he condemns the levity of tho≈øe that are always reading, but never meditating: running over ≈øuch a Book as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently, and then going to another, not ≈øo profitable; and never returning to this again.</p>
                     <p>So I take it in ≈øhort, <hi>Content thy ≈øelf with this Book, and ≈øuch like; and do not turn over many Authors, to learn how to be happy.</hi> For goodne≈øs and truth are included in certain Bounds; but wickedne≈øs and lyes, <hi>≈øine fine ≈øunt,</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> here notes. Who ob≈øerves al≈øo, that perhaps he advi≈øeth us, to ≈øtudy brevity; and to mind the ≈øen≈øe more than the words: directly contrary to the Philo≈øophers and Doctors of the World, who to a≈ø≈øert their fal≈øe Opinions, u≈øe abundance and great variety of Words; but the Divine Scripture, <hi>brevi Circulo coarctata e≈øt,</hi> is confined to a ≈ømall Circle; and as much contracted in Words, as it is dilated in ≈øen≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrew Word <hi>bahag,</hi> which we tran≈ølate <hi>≈øtudy, Aben Ezra</hi> ≈øays, in the neighbouring Languages, ≈øignifies <hi>reading;</hi> and ≈øo we tran≈ølate it in the Margin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> To teach us to contract our labours into as ≈ømall a compa≈øs as we can, he ≈øumms up, in a few Words, the ≈øen≈øe of his whole Di≈øcour≈øe in this Book; which he calls <hi>the conclu≈øion or end of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> of all that can be ≈øaid on this Subject: the whole ≈øen≈øe of the Sermon, ≈øuccinctly delivered; unto which therefore every one ≈øhould confine his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. It is this, to work his Soul unto ≈øuch a due regard of the Divine Maje≈øty (≈øtanding in awe of him as his Lord, Over≈øeer and Judge) that he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46873:131"/>take care to ob≈øerve all his Commandments: without which all Religion is vain and fruitle≈øs.</p>
                     <p>And the≈øe two things (the <hi>fear of God</hi> (or devotion) and <hi>obedience</hi>) he commends from <hi>two</hi> Arguments. The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> of which is in this Ver≈øe; that they are things, which concern all Mankind, one as well as another; of which if they be careful, they have done enough to make them≈øelves immortally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
                     <p>For tho≈øe Words, <hi>this is the whole,</hi> or <hi>the all of man,</hi> may be expounded four ≈øeveral ways: either this is <hi>all the duty of man,</hi> or the <hi>duty of all men;</hi> or the <hi>whole happine≈øs of all men;</hi> or <hi>their whole bu≈øine≈øs;</hi> unto which therefore they ≈øhould devote their <hi>whole ≈øelves;</hi> that is, all their ≈øtrength. For according as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands it, <hi>to this Man was born: that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding God is his Creator, ≈øhould wor≈øhip him with fear, and honour and ob≈øervance of his Commands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>fear of God</hi> being implanted in our minds, we ≈øhall not fail to wor≈øhip Him, and call upon Him, and expect all good things from Him, and give Him thanks for them: And, as the be≈øt expre≈ø≈øion of our thankfulne≈øs, <hi>keep his Commandments,</hi> and be obedient to all his Precepts: both in ≈øubduing our ≈øinful Appetites and Pa≈ø≈øions, and in exerci≈øing Charity towards our Neighbours.

                        <hi>[o] V. 14.]</hi> Here is the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Argument, why we ≈øhould ≈øeriou≈øly intend the≈øe things; becau≈øe the Lord and Judge of the World, will one day call us to an account for what we do here; and pa≈øs an impartial Sentence upon every action of our life, even

                     <p>I will imitate therefore (≈øaith <hi>Melancthon</hi>) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and in the Conclu≈øion recite the ≈øumm of this Book. <q>He intended to a≈ø≈øert Divine Providence; and to refute the Objections again≈øt it. which are the≈øe; There are great confu≈øions in humane life; a va≈øt multitude of ungodly men, and but few that acknowledge, and fear God: and, which is wor≈øe, the wicked flouri≈øh in honour and riches; but the pious are afflicted, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times killed by the wor≈øt of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore all things ≈øeem to be carried by Chance. Unto which <hi>Solomon</hi> an≈øwers: Tho' for the mo≈øt part, ≈øuch be the confu≈øion of things, yet be thou ruled by God's Word; and hold the Opinion of his Providence with a firm Faith. Do not fall from God, becau≈øe of the≈øe Scandals; nor ca≈øt away his fear, or thy confidence in Him; nor de≈øert thy vocation: but oppo≈øe the≈øe <hi>two</hi> things to the≈øe confu≈øions; There will come a Judgment, when God will take away the≈øe confu≈øions and make an exact di≈øtinction: for the wicked ≈øhall be thrown into everla≈øting puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it ≈øhall be well for ever with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.

Nay, this is a te≈øtimony of God's pre≈øence, that when the infirmity of humane Nature is ≈øo great, and ≈øo many are no

                  <p>THat this Book was compo≈øed by <hi>SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON</hi> is no more doubted, than that he was the Author of the two foregoing.</p>
                  <p>And that it was always lookt upon as an Holy Book, treating of ≈øome Spiritual and Divine matter, appears from its being placed among the re≈øt of that kind. Nor hath it been doubted of by any con≈øiderable number of men, either among Jews or Chri≈øtians, but only by a few ≈øingular per≈øons; who ought (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ≈øpeaks in his Preface to this Book) to have lookt upon tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øed Fathers, who placing this Song among the Divine Writings, took it to be fit for the u≈øes of the Church, as men of greater judgment, and more ≈øpiritual than them≈øelves. And they ought likewi≈øe to have con≈øidered (as he adds) that we have, in effect, the te≈øtimony of the Holy Gho≈øt it ≈øelf, for its. Divine Authority: <hi>Ezra,</hi> a man excelling in Vertue and full of the Holy Spirit, having thought this worthy of a room among tho≈øe Sacred Volumes, which he gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after their return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly, a great many holy men have illu≈øtrated it (as he further notes) with their
<pb facs="tcp:46873:135"/>Commentaries and Interpretations, or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned their Writings with its Sentences: ≈øuch as <hi>Eu≈øebius, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> (who wore the Crown of Martyrdom) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is unnece≈ø≈øary to mention tho≈øe that followed after in future times, who all took this for a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Book: let us only con≈øider, whether the≈øe things being ≈øo, it be rea≈øonable for us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øe ≈øo many and ≈øuch great per≈øons, nay the Holy Spirit it ≈øelf, and to follow our own private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; nor hearkning to him that ≈øaid, <hi>The thoughts of mortal man are vain, and our devices are but uncertain, IX.

                     <hi>IV.</hi> But, for the fuller Explication of this, it may be fit to note, that the profounde≈øt of the Hebrew Divines, whom they now call <hi>Cabbali≈øts,</hi> having ≈øuch a Notion as this among them, that <hi>≈øen≈øible things are but an imitation of things above,</hi> conceived from thence, that there was (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance) an Original pattern of that love and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is between a Man and his Wife here in this World This they expre≈ø≈øed by the kindne≈øs
<pb facs="tcp:46873:137"/>of <hi>Tipheret</hi> to <hi>Malcuth:</hi> which are the Names they give unto the invi≈øible Bridegroom and Bride in the upper World.

As <hi>Malcuth</hi> (i. e. Kingdom) they call al≈øo by the name of <hi>Chene≈øeth I≈ørael,</hi> i. e.

So that, in ≈øumm, they ≈øeem to ≈øay the ≈øame that the Apo≈øtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth, when he tells us, that <hi>Marriage is a great My≈øtery; but he ≈øpeaks concerning Chri≈øt and his Church, V. Ephe≈ø. 32.</hi> For the Marriage of <hi>Tipheret</hi> and <hi>Malcuth</hi> (or <hi>Chene≈øeth I≈ørael</hi>) is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chri≈øt, the Lord, from Heaven, with his Spou≈øe the Church, which is the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chri≈øtian people. Which was repre≈øented in the conjunction of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and of all other men and women de≈øcended from them, when they are joined together in holy Matrimony; in≈øomuch that tho≈øe Divines, called <hi>Cabbali≈øts,</hi> have formed this Maxim about this matter; that <hi>where≈øoever in the Scripture we read of the love of Man and Wife, there is my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtically

                  <p>Now if this Notion (of which the Learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath long ago wrote a peculiar Di≈øcour≈øe) was ≈øo ancient among tho≈øe Doctors, that they had it before the times of Chri≈øt; it gives the plaine≈øt account, why <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bapti≈øt</hi> u≈øes the word <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> as if they were in a manner ≈øynonymous, and of the ≈øame import, <hi>III.

                     <hi>VI.</hi> All which things put together ≈øhow how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the thoughts of <hi>David</hi> were led, at <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Marriage, to ≈øing concerning Chri≈øt and his Church; and the thoughts of <hi>Solomon</hi> afterward to ≈øing more largely of the wonderful love of the ≈øame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bridegroom, in this <hi>Song of Songs;</hi> that is, mo≈øt excellent Song. For ≈øo it may be truly called both in regard of its Subject matter; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of its compo≈øure: this Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical way of writing, by Figures and Similitudes, being in many regards (as the forenamed <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øtical</hi> Doctors di≈øcour≈øe) the be≈øt of all others. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> becau≈øe it is taken from things ≈øen≈øible, by which both learned men and ignorant may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øuch Narrations very ea≈øily imprint them≈øelves on the mind: a Parable (≈øay they) being in≈øtead of an artificial Memory. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> becau≈øe all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath its ri≈øe from ≈øen≈øe, and therefore ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizes much with ≈øen≈øible Parables. And <hi>fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it is very delightful to contemplate how the Parable agrees with the ≈øpiritual things, which are thereby figured. <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nto which (≈øaith that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changelus</hi> before-mentioned) the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is conformable, when he ≈øaith, <hi>The invi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God from the creation of the World, are ≈øeen by tho≈øe that are made,</hi> And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> what is there more evident, than
<pb facs="tcp:46873:139"/>that all vi≈øible things declare God to be love? who≈øe prai≈øe <hi>Solomon</hi> celebrates in this Song. For by love, (as the ≈øame Author di≈øcour≈øes out of <hi>Boetius</hi> and others) the Heavens are joyned together, and the Elements agree in compo≈øition, Animals cohabit, Cities are pre≈øerved, and all Kingdoms ≈øupported and repleni≈øhed. Which made <hi>Pherecydes Syrus</hi> ≈øay, that God was transformed into love, before He made the World. And becau≈øe God created all things in love, he al≈øo embraces all things with the ≈øame love; and would have us to love; which is the ≈øumm of all that He exacts of us: that being knit together by mutual love, we may in conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be united with Him in love; that ≈øo all things may be one, as they were in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Of this love, <hi>Solomon</hi> (≈øay they) treats throughout this whole Song; nay, it is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the Book of God. According to that of <hi>David, LXII. P≈øal. 11, 12. God hath ≈øpoken once,</hi> viz. to the whole people of I≈ørael, when he gave the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> yea, <hi>twice have I heard this,</hi> from the Prophets, that is, who ≈øay the ≈øame with the Law, <hi>that power belongeth to God, al≈øo unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou rendere≈øt to every man according to his work.</hi> Which they expound in this manner, Thou can≈øt ≈øend good or evil influences upon us; by the union of <hi>Tipheret</hi> and <hi>Malcuth,</hi> a good influence; by their ≈øeparation, a bad. For when <hi>I≈ørael</hi> doth well, then it receives good influences from above;
<pb facs="tcp:46873:139"/>that is, from <hi>Tipheret:</hi> for <hi>≈øuch is the order</hi> (≈øays one of their Aphori≈øms) <hi>which is con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Archetypal World, that all good influences proceed from Tipheret.</hi> And then the≈øe two Principles are united, when we ob≈øerve God's Precepts; but when we tran≈øgre≈øs the Law, the one is ≈øeparated from the other; that is, <hi>Tipheret</hi> doth not ≈øend influences upon <hi>Malcuth</hi> for our good; but another Principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øes and ≈øends anxiety and trouble. Now Love is the union of the≈øe two Principles: the love of Man and Wife ≈øignifying in Scripture the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nion of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and <hi>Tipheret:</hi> which <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nion <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> ≈øpeaks of, when he ≈øaith, <hi>II. 19, 20. I will betroth me unto thee for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteou≈øne≈øs, and in judgment, and in loving kindne≈øs, and in mercies: I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulne≈øs, and thou ≈øhalt know the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus that ≈øort of Divines di≈øcour≈øe; very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the ≈øen≈øe of this Book.

The literal ≈øen≈øe of which, and of the next Ver≈øe, I have expre≈ø≈øed ≈øo fully in the Paraphra≈øe, annexing the ≈øpiritual ≈øen≈øe at the end, that I do not think fit to enlarge upon it here.

And what greater joy have we here than to think of the ≈øtupendous love of God our Saviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us? which cannot but ≈øubdue our hearts to love Him intirely. So I have paraphra≈øed the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Ver≈øe <hi>(his Banner over me was love)</hi> taking in two ≈øen≈øes of which the Words are capable.

And that we may alway look upon it and never quail, He carries it over us; that is, renders his love mo≈øt familiar to us. He that knows not this Banner, can be none of his Souldiers; and he that de≈øerts it, is undone, unle≈øs he pre≈øently return to it. So that as the <hi>Roman Legions</hi> had their ≈øeveral names
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46873:155"/>(one of which was called the <hi>Pious,</hi> and another the <hi>Faithful,</hi> another the <hi>Thundring,</hi> another the <hi>Victorious,</hi> &amp;c.) in like manner the Chri≈øtian Band may be called <hi>Amoris Legio,</hi> the Legion of Love.</q>

(as well as Wine) which are all comprehended under the name of <hi>tappuach</hi> in the Hebrew: which is a Word that in its very Original imports an <hi>exhalation,</hi> or <hi>odour-breathing</hi> from that which is ≈øo called. By all which the Church is repre≈øented to be ≈øo marvellou≈øly affected with the love of Chri≈øt, as to be even oppre≈ø≈øed under the weight of Divine Benefits: and at a perfect lo≈øs, what to think of them; having little or nothing to return for ≈øuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite obligations.</p>

                        <hi>[n] V. 14.

Which forced Chri≈øtians to hold their A≈ø≈øemblies under ground, in ob≈øcure places (where they ≈øung Hymns to our Ble≈ø≈øed Lord before the break of day) and made the Church perfectly like a Dove, who, being in fear of ravenous Birds, flies into Clefts of Rocks, and to ≈øecret Holes in ≈øteep places, to pre≈øerve her ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>The Church is ≈øo often compared by Chri≈øt to a <hi>Dove</hi> in this Book, that it is fit to give ≈øome account of it. And <hi>Bochartus de Sacr.

In which Vi≈øion (looking upon Him as actually come) he endeavours to retain Him, and to bring Him into the Temple, there to ≈øhow Him to all the pious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhippers of the Divine Maje≈øty. For that is literally the <hi>Hou≈øe of my Mother:</hi> As <hi>Cheder Corathi (the Chamber of her that conceived me)</hi> I take to be the inward part of that Hou≈øe; or the <hi>mo≈øt Holy place.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.

For it is their voice, which we read in this Ver≈øe: where the Word <hi>zoth</hi> may be tran≈ølated either <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>who:</hi> and by the <hi>Wilderne≈øs</hi> may be under≈øtood the forlorn condition, wherein men were before, not only in <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tili≈øm,</hi> but even in the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> E≈øtate. Which made it more wonderful, that the Church ≈øhould come thus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46873:162"/>richly adorned (expre≈ø≈øed here by the <hi>Perfumes</hi> of her Garments) to be brought in State and Pomp to the King's Palace; there to be e≈øpou≈øed to Him. But all that gave up them≈øelves to Him becoming thereby an holy people, were highly e≈øteemed by Him: and therefore compared here to the <hi>Pillars of Smoak</hi> (as I take it) that went up every day from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Burnt-offering, at the Temple, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and a≈øcended in a ≈øtrait Line, like a firm Pillar, that was not in the lea≈øt moved from its uprightne≈øs, though the Wind blew never ≈øo boi≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly. So the Jews report in <hi>Pirke Avoth, C. 5.</hi> and in other Books: where the≈øe are reckoned among the <hi>ten Miracles</hi> which were ≈øeen in the Temple: that <hi>the greate≈øt rain never put out the fire; and the mo≈øt vehement winds never di≈øper≈øed, or in the lea≈øt bent the ≈ømoak:</hi> but it went up ≈øtedfa≈øtly to heaven. And how acceptable ≈øuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons were to Chri≈øt, is further repre≈øented by the <hi>≈øweet Perfumes</hi> which were burnt upon the Altar of Incen≈øe. For <hi>Solomon,</hi> I conceive, here alludes (in the la≈øt Clau≈øe of this Ver≈øe) to that compo≈øition, which God ordered to be made of ≈øweet Spices for his own ≈øervice at the Tabernacle: which none might pre≈øume to imitate, or make u≈øe of in other places, <hi>XXX.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46873:168"/>lookt upon the≈øe, and the re≈øt that follow, only as parts of tho≈øe things that make up together a perfect beauty. <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath made the apte≈øt applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I can find, which is this: that <hi>hair</hi> ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying what is ≈øuperfluous, the meaning may be (if there be any of every particular in this De≈øcription) that <hi>even in humane things, and worldly Affairs, wherewith we cannot but be ≈øometime perplexed, the Church behaves her ≈øelf lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and pre≈øerves a</hi> decorum.</p>

                        <hi>[b] V. 2. Thy teeth are like a flock of ≈øheep]</hi> Here follows a de≈øcription of the <hi>Teeth;</hi> which are a great part of the beauty of the mouth, as that is of the face. And their beauty con≈øi≈øts in their white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; in their evenne≈øs and ju≈øt proportions; and in their clo≈øene≈øs and firmne≈øs: ≈øo that there be none wanting, nor any Gap between them. Which are all here expre≈ø≈øed, and ≈øaid to be like a <hi>Flock of Sheep come from the wa≈øhing,</hi> in re≈øpect of whitene≈øs; and as equal as if they had been exactly poli≈øhed and fitted for their places, in ju≈øt proportion, by an Artificer (≈øo the Word we tran≈ølate <hi>≈øhorn</hi> ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) they that are below al≈øo an≈øwering to tho≈øe above, as if they were <hi>Twins.</hi> And none of them <hi>mi≈øcarry</hi> (≈øo that which we tran≈ølate <hi>barren</hi> ≈øhould be rendred) <hi>i. e.</hi> drops out of the mouth: which is as much as to ≈øay, there is a perfect number, as well as order of them.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Teeth</hi> being the In≈øtruments whereby we chew our Meat, they may be lookt upon as an apt Emblem of the inferior Pa≈øtors in the Church: who prepare Chri≈øtian Doctrine for the people. Which Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I have not adventured to make in my Paraphra≈øe (becau≈øe I take the≈øe <hi>five</hi> fir≈øt Ver≈øes to mean no more, but only to ≈øet forth the loveline≈øs of the Church in general, by the Figure of a Virgin, of a mo≈øt accompli≈øhed beauty) yet, I ≈øhall here note,

                        <hi>[c] V. 3. Thy lips,</hi> &amp;c.] In the beginning of this Ver≈øe there is no great difficulty: it being certain that <hi>Schani</hi> (the colour of the lips) ≈øignifies ≈øome very bright and re≈øplendent colour; which ≈øtrikes the eyes ≈øharply (as it originally ≈øeems to import) <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>Scarlet,</hi> as we tran≈ølate it, or <hi>Crim≈øon,</hi> or <hi>Purple:</hi> ≈øuch as the Poets call <hi>Coral Lips.</hi> Who≈øe finene≈øs is here compared to a <hi>Thread;</hi> and is another great part of Beauty: as a ≈øweet accent of the <hi>Voice</hi> al≈øo is; nothing being more ungrateful than a tone that is coar≈øe and clowni≈øh.</p>
                     <p>If any li≈øt to apply the≈øe particularly to ≈øomething in the Church; the <hi>Lips</hi> may be thought to ≈øignifie the Teachers in the Church, who delivered the Doctrine they had learnt from the higher Mini≈øters; who had prepared it for them; and, by them, for the people. And then the <hi>voice</hi> ≈øignifies their excellent manner of preaching: in≈øinuating into the hearts of tho≈øe that heard them; being accompanied with great mode≈øty and humility, though full of authority and power. Unto which only the la≈øt Clau≈øe of this Ver≈øe can be applied; which is this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>thy Temples are like a piece of a Pomegranate, within thy locks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Words puzzle Interpreters. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> that which we tran≈ølate <hi>Temples;</hi> which are not reckoned as a part of the beauty of the face, e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being cover'd by the <hi>Locks:</hi> and why they ≈øhould be likened to a <hi>Slice of a Pomegranate,</hi> is hard to tell. <hi>Grotius</hi> therefore, by the Temples under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands the <hi>Cheeks</hi> (as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> doth) which in regard of their redne≈øs, are like to the Grains or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46873:169"/>within a Pomegranate. So the <hi>Chaldee</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed interprets the other Word, a <hi>piece of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate:</hi> when he thus glo≈ø≈øes, <hi>They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleni≈øhed,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> ju≈øt and pious men to whom he applies it) <hi>with Precepts, as a Pomegranate:</hi> i. e. as a Pomegranate is with Kernels or Grains with which it abounds, and to which that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no doubt, hath re≈øpect.</p>
                     <p>But our learned Dr. <hi>Ca≈øtell</hi> hath out of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Languages more clearly explained both the≈øe Words, and the la≈øt al≈øo; and hath made them all ea≈øie and natural, by ≈øhewing that the whole Clau≈øe is thus mo≈øt exactly tran≈ølated: as the <hi>Flower of the Pomegranate, ≈øo are thy Cheeks without a Veil.</hi> So he tran≈ølates the la≈øt Words, which we met withal before, v. <hi>1. mibbaath let≈øammatech</hi> not <hi>within thy locks;</hi> but <hi>without a Veil.</hi> That is, when thy veil is laid a≈øide, thy Cheeks appear of a mo≈øt lovely colour; for ≈øuch is that of the Pomegranate-Flower; the pure≈øt white and red, mo≈øt exactly mixed.

But what an≈øwers to this in the Body of the Church, I know not; unle≈øs we admit the Opinion of R. <hi>Solomon</hi> and others of that Nation: who will have this to be the place where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had a Room called in their Language <hi>Liskath haggazith, the Chamber</hi> or <hi>Parlour of ≈øquare Stones</hi> (which ≈øome Interpreters have thought to be the meaning of <hi>built letalpijoth</hi> with ≈øquare Stones) where Judgment was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtred, and their Di≈øcipline pre≈øerved. Which was the ≈øtrength and ≈øupport of the Nation, as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of the Apo≈øtles and Elders, mentioned <hi>Act. XV.</hi> was of the Chri≈øtian Church: who ≈øetled all doubts and Controver≈øies, as future Councils were to do, and thereby maintained the Church in order and peace. From which <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth not much differ, when he ≈øaith the Church hath many Shields, whereby it is defended. <hi>For thou art armed with all the Weapons of the Spirit</hi> (≈øaith he para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øing upon the≈øe Words) <hi>whereby thou ea≈øily wounde≈øt thy Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ≈øometimes do≈øt refel them by the Prophets, ≈øometimes by the Apo≈øtles; and laye≈øt open their weakne≈øs.</hi>

Thy two brea≈øts,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>two Paps</hi> ri≈øe upon the Brea≈øt, like Lilies from the Ground: among which if we conceive two red Kids feeding, that were Twins and perfectly alike, they appeared like the <hi>Nipples</hi> or <hi>Teats</hi> upon the Paps, to tho≈øe that beheld them afar off. Thus <hi>Bochart</hi> explains this Compari≈øon: which ≈øets forth the exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the pure complexion of the <hi>Brea≈øts;</hi> unto which, mo≈øt think the Two Te≈øtaments, the Old

Who thinks the≈øe are called <hi>Twins,</hi> becau≈øe of their perfect agreement and concord in the Chri≈øtian Doctrine: though one of them bent their endeavours mo≈øt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the conver≈øion of the Jews, and the other of the Gentiles.

                        <hi>[f] V. 6. mountain of myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c.] Here now the de≈øcription ≈øtops, and proceeds no further to the lower Members of the Church: which are not particularly commended, but it is only intimated that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Guides and Directors, they made up a beautiful Body; though for the pre≈øent ob≈øcured by the Night of per≈øecution, as the fir≈øt Words of this Ver≈øe may be applied. Which Body might be well compared to a <hi>Mountain of Myrrhe, and Hill of Frankincen≈øe,</hi> that is, to Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> and <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> ≈øay the Hebrews (and ≈øo the Church is called the <hi>New Jeru≈øalem</hi> in the Revelation) where the ≈øweet incen≈øe made of the≈øe and other Spices <hi>(XXX.

                     <p>I know it is commonly thought that other Mountains (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards mentioned, v. <hi>8.</hi>) are here meant: about
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46873:170"/>which I ≈øhall not di≈øpute.

The ≈øame I ob≈øerve in other places of that Author; and therefore have made the allu≈øion here only to the preciou≈øne≈øs of the≈øe things; which were no where ≈øo excellent as in tho≈øe Countries. And I have taken this Ver≈øe to be ≈øtill in prai≈øe of the before-de≈øcribed Beauty: for it is evident, from the following Ver≈øe, he had not yet done with that matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7. Thou art all fair,</hi> &amp;c.] And here, to comprehend all that could be ≈øaid, he enlarges the commendation which he began withal, v. <hi>1.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in the≈øe Words that there was no defect in any part: but altogether they made up a compleat Beauty without the lea≈øt ≈øpeck of deformity. Which is not to be applied to every particular per≈øon in the Church: but, as I have taken it in the Paraphra≈øe, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Con≈øtitution of the whole, in which there was no imperfection.</p>

                        <hi>[g] V. 8.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Theodoret</hi> therefore here begins his <hi>Third</hi> Book, very judiciou≈øly: and we may look upon this as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of the Church, coming out of the ≈øtate of per≈øecution: and receiving greater te≈øtimonies of her Saviour<hi>'s</hi> love than ever. For coming from the top of high <hi>Mountains,</hi> where there were <hi>Lyons Dens,</hi> and where <hi>Leopards</hi> inhabited; cannot well ≈øignifie any thing el≈øe, than coming from places where they were in danger to be devoured by their Per≈øecutors: who are compared to <hi>Lyons</hi> in many places of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>As for the Mountains them≈øelves, they are well-known where they were. Only <hi>Amana</hi> ≈øome have fan≈øied to be, that Mountain in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> called <hi>Amanus:</hi> which is reckoned among the highe≈øt; and joined by <hi>Aelian</hi> with <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Carmel.</hi> We read al≈øo that there were Tygers and Panthers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Mountain; which hath been brought to countenance this Opinion. But <hi>Judaea</hi> and the Neighbouring places, being the Scene of this Poem, we are not to go ≈øo far off as <hi>Cilicia</hi> to ≈øeek for <hi>Amana:</hi> for as <hi>Senir</hi> and <hi>Hermon</hi> were but parts of the ≈øame Mountains; ≈øo <hi>Amana</hi> was a part of <hi>Libanus,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath ob≈øerved in his <hi>Canaan,</hi> L.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46873:171"/>with wild Bea≈øts. From whence the <hi>Spou≈øe</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come into more delightful and ≈øecure places: for ≈øhe is compared pre≈øently after to a <hi>Garden</hi> or <hi>Paradi≈øe,</hi> v. <hi>12, 13,</hi> &amp;c. And it is no wonder <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øhould have the ≈øtate of the Chri≈øtian Church in trouble, thus repre≈øented to him: it being very ≈øuitable to the ≈øtate of the Church of the Jews, when it was fir≈øt formed; being then pre≈ø≈øed by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and many other Enemies afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                     <p>It may be interpreted al≈øo, <hi>the lea≈øt glance I have of thee and of thy beauty, mightily engages my love to thee:</hi> for the eyes are the very <hi>Seat of Love,</hi> as abundance of Authors expre≈øs it.</p>

                     <p>If this Expo≈øition of this difficult Ver≈øe be not allowed, it may be ≈øuppo≈øed that the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah</hi> is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented as coming in the per≈øon and condition of a poor man, to beg entertainment, and having not where to lay his head (as our Lord ≈øpeaks) was thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the cold Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which will make this a commendation of Charity to the Church; ≈øhowing al≈øo the danger of neglecting it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> And then this Ver≈øe agrees perfectly with what we read in the Parable, <hi>XI. Luke 7.</hi> Where the good man of the hou≈øe was unwilling to be troubled, even by his Friend, that came to beg his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, when he was going to compo≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to re≈øt. But I take it to be a de≈øcription of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46873:180"/>the dullne≈øs, which is ≈øometimes apt to creep upon the mo≈øt excellent minds: who, in ≈øome tempers, are ≈øo li≈øtle≈øs as not to be much affected with the be≈øt motions that are made to them. Of which infirmity <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> having had many Examples in the Hi≈øtory of his own Nation, might well conceive the Spou≈øe her ≈øelf to be backward to entertain the Grace which was offered to her.</p>
                     <p>There are no difficulties in the Words; which ≈øignifie plainly, that ≈øhe having compo≈øed her ≈øelf to re≈øt, and being half a≈øleep, was unwilling to be di≈øturbed. For going into Bed, ≈øhe had put off her cloaths, and wa≈øhed her feet; as the manner was, that no filth which they had contracted in the day time (they wearing Sandals only, not Shoes, as we do) might foul the Sheets: and it would have been a trouble to do all this over again; which is the meaning of the la≈øt Words. <hi>How ≈øhall I defile them?</hi> i. e. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ea≈øily per≈øwade my ≈øelf to it.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall only therefore ≈øet down the pious note of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> upon the≈øe Words. <q>Let us learn from hence, what mi≈øchief ≈øloth and lazine≈øs doth, and in what troubles and pains it engegeth us. For the Spou≈øe here excu≈øing her ≈øelf, and not being willing pre≈øently to ri≈øe to the Bridegroom, is compelled a little while after, not only to ri≈øe and run to the door, but to run through the City, and wander about the Streets, and fall among the Watch-men, and by them to be wounded; and after all could ≈øcarce find her Beloved: to whom if ≈øhe had pre≈øently hearkned, and obeyed his heavenly call, ≈øhe had avoided all the≈øe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are tho≈øe, not only among us but al≈øo, in the Romi≈øh Church, who apply all this lazine≈øs to the State of the Church after the time of the Great <hi>Con≈øtantine.</hi> For which I ≈øee no warrant; but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46873:180"/>think we may rather apply it to tho≈øe Churches, who, pre≈øently after our Saviour's departure to Heaven, left their fir≈øt Love, and grew cold, as we read in the <hi>≈øecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Chapters of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For it ≈øeems probable, by the VIth Chapter of this Book in the beginning of it, that here he ≈øpeaks of particular Societies, not of the whole Body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> Yet, ≈øuch is the infinite Goodne≈øs of the Divine Nature, he immediately repre≈øents the Me≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, as not provoked by this neglect, wholly to ca≈øt off his Spou≈øe: but rather ≈øtretching forth his hand to awaken her out of this ≈øecurity. For ≈øo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>He put in his hand by the hole;</hi> i. e. at the <hi>Window,</hi> or <hi>Ca≈øement;</hi> as if he would draw her out of her Bed: or, as it may be interpreted, in a threatning manner, to puni≈øh her for her ≈øloth. For ≈øo <hi>putting forth the hand</hi> ≈øignifies, to do ≈øome execution, <hi>1 Sam. XXVI. 9, 11, 23.</hi> Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with what follows, that pre≈øently ≈øhe was mightily moved thereby, and more than awakened, being full of ≈øolicitude, and fear, and grief and trouble. Which ≈øhows indeed, that ≈øhe did not intend to deny, but only to delay Him: and yet He took this ≈øo ill, as to put her in great fear of ≈øome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from it (as our Saviour doth in his Letters to the Churches, <hi>II. Revel. 5, 16, 22, 23, &amp;c.</hi>) For the Word <hi>Bowels</hi> ≈øignifies the affections, and pa≈ø≈øions; and the Hebrew Word <hi>hamu,</hi> which we tran≈ølate <hi>was moved,</hi> ≈øignifies <hi>made a noi≈øe,</hi> or <hi>was tumultuous:</hi> and therefore denotes the pa≈ø≈øion of trouble and grief, and of fear al≈øo; nay, of great fear and perplexity.

                     <p>And thus far we have only the de≈øcription of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gracious Maje≈øty: which is much advanced by a ≈øweet voice and eloquent ≈øpeech.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14.]</hi> If we under≈øtand the fir≈øt Part of this Ver≈øe to be meant of the hands, it is thus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, <hi>He hath Golden Rings on his Fingers</hi> (as before he is ≈øaid, v. <hi>11.</hi> to have a golden Head, i. e. <hi>a Crown of Gold</hi> upon it) <hi>≈øet with the Chry≈øolith:</hi> as <hi>Tar≈øis</hi> (which the LXX here do not tran≈ølate) it is mo≈øt probable ≈øignifies. And then the latter part of the Ver≈øe ≈øounds thus, word for word; <hi>his Belly is of poli≈øhed Ivory, covered with Sapphire:</hi> i. e. is purely white ≈øtreaked with blue Veins. But, who ≈øees not that though this be ingenious, yet it is not true? For the Body is no where <hi>covered</hi> (as the Word here is) with Veins: which mu≈øt needs ≈øignifie more than <hi>≈øtreaked</hi> here and there. And be≈øides, it is not only again≈øt the Rules of decency, but again≈øt the very ≈øcope of this Di≈øcour≈øe, to fan≈øie that any of tho≈øe naked Parts of the Body are here de≈øcribed, which are not commonly expo≈øed to every Bodies view. For the Spou≈øe is de≈øired to tell, by what marks this per≈øon might be di≈øcovered, v. <hi>9.</hi> now He could not be known by any of tho≈øe parts which lie concealed and hidden from all mens eyes, being indu≈øtriou≈øly covered. And therefore no ≈øuch hidden parts are here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented; becau≈øe He could not thereby be known and di≈øtingui≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that now ≈øhe proceeds to de≈øcribe the habit of this Great Per≈øon. And <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:46873:185"/>having in his mind the <hi>Idea</hi> which his Father had given him of the Me≈ø≈øiah, in the CXth P≈øalm, (where He is ≈øaid to be a Prie≈øt as well as a Prince) repre≈øents Him in the habit of the High Prie≈øt. Who, among other noble Ve≈øtments, had an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Coat;</hi> the <hi>Sleeves</hi> of which, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews tell us, came down to his very Wri≈øts; nay, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ≈øaith, as far as to the hollow of his hand. Which I take to be here meant by <hi>his hands</hi> (which comprehend the <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>) that is, the clothing of tho≈øe Parts. And the≈øe <hi>Sleeves,</hi> as well as the whole Coat, were <hi>embroidered</hi> (as you read, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 4.</hi>) to make the High Prie≈øt appear the more glorious. And if you ask what this <hi>Embroidery</hi> was, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews tell us, that part of it con≈øi≈øted in a kind of <hi>oilet holes,</hi> finely wrought. And R. <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> expre≈øly ≈øaith upon that Text, that <hi>they were holes made in golden Rings, in which were fixed Precious Stones,</hi> &amp;c. (as is afterward ≈øaid of the Stones of the Ephod, v. <hi>11.</hi>) Which ≈øo fully explains the≈øe Words, <hi>His hands are as Gold Rings, ≈øet with the Beryl,</hi> that I need ≈øeek no further. Though I have ≈øometimes thought, that the <hi>Ephod</hi> it ≈øelf might be here intended: which being fa≈øtned upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi> (which in order, after the head, eyes, cheeks and lips, come to be here de≈øcribed, and are comprehended, as I ≈øaid before, under the name of <hi>his hands</hi>) hung down before and behind to the bottom of the back: and had <hi>two golden Rings,</hi> unto which the Brea≈øt-plate was fa≈øtned, as we read <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 27, 28. Maimonides</hi> ≈øaith it had <hi>four</hi> Rings: two above, at the Jewel-Buttons; and two below, about the Girdle of the <hi>Ephod.</hi> Which was one of the principal Ornaments of the High Prie≈øt, when He mini≈øtred: the other, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46873:185"/>greate≈øt of all, was the <hi>Brea≈øt-plate</hi> hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; and, as they ≈øay, was to be in≈øeparable from the Ephod.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Brea≈øt-plate</hi> is meant, as I take it, in the latter part of this Ver≈øe. Where under that Word which we tran≈ølate <hi>Belly,</hi> and properly ≈øignifies <hi>Bowels,</hi> is comprehended the <hi>Brea≈øt,</hi> and all: Which this CHOSCHEN, as the Hebrews call it, covered: and as it covered tho≈øe parts, ≈øo was it ≈øelf covered, or <hi>overlaid</hi> with <hi>twelve</hi> Precious Stones. The <hi>Sapphire,</hi> which was the <hi>tenth,</hi> is only here mentioned; but it is u≈øual in Scripture, to touch only upon one thing in a Hi≈øtory, when the whole is intended. And be≈øides, it is evident from the foregoing part of this Ver≈øe, that more mu≈øt be under≈øtood, when one alone is mentioned: for <hi>Rings</hi> are ≈øpoken of in the Plural Number, and ≈øaid to be filled with <hi>Tar≈øis;</hi> which mu≈øt therefore denote more Stones than one; as <hi>Sapphire</hi> doth all the re≈øt of the <hi>twelve,</hi> which could not be mentioned in ≈øo ≈øhort a de≈øcription. Or <hi>Sepphirim</hi> here, in the Plural Number, may ≈øignifie Stones as precious as the <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire.</hi> Certain it is the <hi>Chaldee Paraphra≈øt</hi> thought there was ≈øome re≈øpect here to the High Prie≈øt's <hi>Brea≈øt-plate;</hi> for he mentions all the Stones therein, one by one. Which may make this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mine to ≈øeem le≈øs ≈øtrange. And I conceive the <hi>Sapphire</hi> to be here mentioned rather than any other; becau≈øe it is of the colour of the Heavens, and fitte≈øt to repre≈øent the ≈øublime Dignity in which He is now de≈øcribed. For the Pavement under the feet of the God of I≈ørael, when He appeared unto their Nobles at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was of this colour, <hi>XXIV. Exod. 10.</hi> and ≈øo was the Throne of God in the Firmament, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ≈øaw, <hi>I. Ezek. 26.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:46873:186"/>
Nor need it ≈øeem ≈øtrange that the <hi>Belly,</hi> upon which this covering was, is ≈øaid to be of <hi>poli≈øhed Ivory</hi> (when there is no mention of any ≈øuch thing in the Law) for it only denotes that it was as ≈øhining and bright as that: and may po≈ø≈øibly relate to the Tunick or Coat of fine Linen, wherein the High Prie≈øt was to mini≈øter <hi>XXXVIII. Exod. 39. XXXIX. 27.</hi>) e≈øpecially upon the great day of expiation, when he was not to put on his Robe, nor his fine Linen Coat, with any Embroidery, but of fine Linen alone, <hi>XVI. Lev. 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The LXX ≈øeem to think it was the Brea≈øt-plate it ≈øelf (which indeed was very ≈øhining) for they tran≈ølate it <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: which ≈øhows they meant ≈øome covering of the Belly which was hollow; as the Brea≈øt-plate was. Which I doubt not is the <hi>covering of Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires</hi> here mentioned: it being ≈øet, as you read, with <hi>twelve</hi> large Precious Stones, wherein were engraven the names of the twelve Children of I≈ørael. And was the mo≈øt precious part of all the High Prie≈øt's habit; and therefore more commonly called by the Jews an <hi>Ornament,</hi> than a <hi>Garment,</hi> or any part of his Ve≈øture: the whole of which was contrived <hi>for Glory and for Beauty,</hi> XXVIII. Exod. <hi>40.</hi> i. e. that God might be ≈øerved mo≈øt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[p] V. 15.]</hi> Next in order follows the de≈øcription of the <hi>Thighs;</hi> that is, of the Garments upon the Thighs: which were the very fir≈øt that the High Prie≈øt put on, when he went about to clothe him≈øelf for his Mini≈øtry. And are here ≈øaid to be made of <hi>Sche≈øch:</hi> which is a Word common to <hi>fine Linen,</hi> and to <hi>pure white Marble</hi> (≈øo the LXX twice tran≈ølate it <hi>Parian Marble, I. E≈øth. 6. 2 Chron XXIX. 2.</hi>) which the <hi>Breeches</hi> of the Prie≈øt re≈øembled, being made of <hi>By≈ø≈øus,</hi> or pure fine Linen; a thing of great price in tho≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46873:186"/>as appears both by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Pau≈øanias.</hi> The latter of which Authors in his <hi>Eliaca,</hi> mentions this among the rare things (which were worthy of admiration) in that Country; and ≈øaith, <hi>It was not inferiour to the By≈ø≈øus of the Hebrews.</hi> Who were ordered to make this part of the Prie≈øt's Garments of <hi>twined fine Linen, XXXIX. Exod. 28.</hi> which rendred them the more ≈øub≈øtantial; and made them ≈øit the fuller and ≈øtiffer, like <hi>Pillars.</hi> For the Hebrews ≈øay they were made of <hi>≈øix-thread By≈ø≈øus:</hi> and that they came down to the Knees; where they were not gathered at the bottom, but ≈øat open.</p>
                     <p>Below which <hi>Breeches</hi> came down the holy <hi>Meil</hi> or Robe, upon the Skirts whereof hung round about Bells made of pure Gold, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 34.</hi> Which may po≈ø≈øibly be the Ba≈øis of fine Gold, here mentioned, to which the <hi>Femoralia,</hi> or Garments on the Thighs, reached. Some refer all this only to his ≈øtately gate, and Princely motion: others to his ≈øtrength and firmne≈øs (which lies much in the Thighs) and his ability to march again≈øt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and pur≈øue them. And then the Sockets of fine Gold are his <hi>Sandals,</hi> bound upon his feet with golden Ribbands, or ≈øomething of that nature. The Reader may chu≈øe which he thinks mo≈øt probable, for the explication of the fir≈øt Part of this Ver≈øe, <hi>His legs</hi> (or <hi>thighs</hi> rather) <hi>are as pillars of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øet upon ≈øockets of fine Gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if my conjecture be allowed, then the latter part of the Ver≈øe will not be hard to explain. For this and all the re≈øt of his habit being contrived for <hi>Beauty and Glory,</hi> as was ≈øaid before from <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 40.</hi> it made the High Prie≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with an unu≈øual Maje≈øty: the riches of the≈øe Ve≈øtments being not ea≈øily to be valued. And ≈øo his <hi>countenance,</hi> or rather his <hi>a≈øpect,</hi> his <hi>whole
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46873:187"/>appearance</hi> (as the Hebrew Word may ≈øignifie) <hi>was as ≈øtately as Lebanon.</hi> Which was one of the goodlie≈øt Sites in tho≈øe Countries both for Cedars; and many other things: e≈øpecially after <hi>Solomon</hi> had made his Garden there, of which we read in the foregoing Chapter, ver. <hi>15, 16.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto which lovely Fore≈øt and Garden, the appearance of the High Prie≈øt may be the better compared; becau≈øe there were Flowers, as well as Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, if we may believe <hi>Philo</hi> (in his <hi>third</hi> Book of the <hi>Life of Mo≈øes</hi>) wrought in the bottom of the holy Robe. Which the LXX al≈øo affirm in expre≈øs Words; that there was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>, a <hi>flowry Work,</hi> as well as <hi>Pomegranates</hi> and <hi>Bells</hi> in the Hem of the <hi>Meil, XXVIII. Exod. 34.</hi> And indeed the Pomegranates being made of Wool of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, they them≈øelves might look like divers ≈øorts of Flowers. And, be≈øides this, it is to be ob≈øerved that ≈øeveral other parts of the High Prie≈øt's habit are peculiarly commanded to be made of a Work called <hi>Cho≈øcheb,</hi> which we tran≈ølate <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning work.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ephod</hi> is ordered to be wrought, <hi>XXVIII.

The <hi>Girdle</hi> moreover is ordered to be made of a Work called <hi>rokem,</hi> which we tran≈ølate <hi>needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,</hi> ver. <hi>39.</hi> becau≈øe it is thought not to have differed from the former, ≈øave only in this; that the other things were only woven curiou≈øly, but this al≈øo curiou≈øly wrought with the Needle. The Jews give another difference; that this was wrought ≈øo that the Figures appeared on both ≈øides, the other only on one. About which I ≈øhall not trouble my ≈øelf, but only take notice that <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> (in his <hi>third Book of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:46873:187"/>Chap. <hi>8.</hi>) explains this Work thus, <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were woven in this Girdle, with Scarlet, Purple, Blue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>Flowers,</hi> and (as others ≈øay) <hi>Animals,</hi> then in all probability, <hi>Trees</hi> al≈øo were wrought in the≈øe Prie≈øtly Ve≈øtures: which made the fuller repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Fore≈øt. Among which that of <hi>Lebanon</hi> was the principal, and indeed the mo≈øt beautiful place in all tho≈øe Countries, which made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expre≈øs the Glory of the Church in the≈øe Words, <hi>The Glory of Lebanon ≈øhall be given to it, XXXV.

                     <p>The whole denotes, that Communion with Him is only to be ≈øought in his Church: e≈øpecially in that part of it, which pre≈øerves the Order, wherein He hath di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed all things (like the Walks and Beds in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) and keep them≈øelves al≈øo in the purity of his Religion.</p>

And le≈øt this ≈øhould not be high enough, He next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares her to <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> which was the mo≈øt lovely place in the Territories of <hi>Judah,</hi> and indeed of the whole Country.

For ≈øo the fir≈øt Clau≈øe of this Ver≈øe may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølated, <hi>turn thine eyes towards me:</hi> the Hebrew Phra≈øe, ≈øignifying not only to turn ones ≈øelf from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but ≈øometimes to turn towards them; as <hi>1 Chron. XII. 23.</hi> And then we are to conceive that He ≈øpeaks to her, as one a≈øhamed to look upon Him; whom ≈øhe had ≈øo much di≈øobliged: and bids her take more confidence, for He was ≈øtill in love with her.</p>
                     <p>If we follow the common Tran≈ølation, I take the ≈øen≈øe ≈øtill to be the ≈øame: that ≈øhe need not trouble her ≈øelf any further; for ≈øhe had prevailed in her ≈øute to be re≈øtored to his favour. The looking of the eyes towards one, is as much as entreating and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning: which He tells her ≈øhe might cea≈øe, by bidding her turn her eyes away from Him.</p>
                     <p>But it is mo≈øt ordinarily taken for an amorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion: as if He had ≈øaid, her eyes were ≈øo bright and dazling, he could not bear the pa≈ø≈øion they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>

Of the latter part of the Ver≈øe, ≈øee an account upon Chap. IV. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> There is no difference between this Ver≈øe and that in <hi>IV. 2.</hi> but only in one Word; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the ≈øen≈øe. And as <hi>harechelim, ≈øheep</hi> was to be fetcht from hence to ≈øupply the ≈øen≈øe there: ≈øo another Word, <hi>hakketzuboth, even ≈øhorn,</hi> is to be fetcht from thence to ≈øupply it here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> This is al≈øo exactly the ≈øame with the latter end of the <hi>third</hi> Ver≈øe of the IVth Chapter. The LXX have al≈øo the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> part: but they might as well have added all that there follows; which is here omitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Here, mo≈øt think, <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes to the number of his own Wives; who were fewer, they ≈øuppo≈øe, in the beginning of his Reign (as <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> him≈øelf gathers from the≈øe Words, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle to the now Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> p. <hi>126.</hi>) and that then he compo≈øed this Song, before he let the Reins of his lu≈øt ≈øo prodigiou≈øly loo≈øe, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we read he did, <hi>1 King. XI. 1,</hi> &amp;c. But it is not at all likely that he had ≈øo many as are here mentioned, while his mind was filled with ≈øuch Divine raptures as the≈øe: And therefore I ≈øuppo≈øe he alludes to the cu≈øtom of other Princes in the Ea≈øt; who, be≈øides their principal Wives that were ≈øolemnly e≈øpou≈øed and endowed, had al≈øo another ≈øort who were neither: and yet were Wives, called by the Hebrews <hi>Philag≈øhim, Concubines.</hi> And ≈øuch a difference the <hi>Romans</hi> antiently made between her whom they called <hi>Matrona,</hi> who was only taken in marriage; and her whom they called <hi>Materfamili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> who was taken al≈øo to order and govern the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and who≈øe Children inherited. As may be ≈øeen in <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> L. XVIII. C. <hi>8.</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes <hi>Aelius Meli≈ø≈øus,</hi> a conceited Grammarian, who had ≈øtarted other, ungrounded Notions of the≈øe Words.</p>

                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:46873:193"/>
And then <hi>three≈øcore</hi> and <hi>four≈øcore,</hi> are only a certain number for an uncertain; not the preci≈øe number of the≈øe Wives and Concubines. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinks by the≈øe are my≈øtically intended, ≈øeveral Ranks of Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Church: ≈øome more, ≈øome le≈øs perfect: But they di≈øcour≈øe better, in my Opinion, who rather accommodate the≈øe to the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Heretical and Schi≈ømatical Churches: ≈øome of which gloried in the multitude of their Followers, and in their wealth and ≈øplendour: but Chri≈øt hath only one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, more glorious than them all put together; as it follows here in the next Ver≈øes. And thus, in effect, R. <hi>Solomon Jarchi,</hi> and ≈øome other Hebrew Expo≈øitors, under≈øtand the≈øe Words, with application to them≈øelves. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Po≈øterity, ≈øay they, till the De≈øcendants from <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were <hi>three≈øcore</hi> in number (compared here to <hi>Queens.</hi>) The Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> and their De≈øcendants unto <hi>Abraham</hi> were <hi>four≈øcore</hi> (compared to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.) The re≈øt who came from <hi>Cham, I≈øhamael</hi> and <hi>E≈øau,</hi> could not be comprehended under a certain number.

Thus it is mo≈øt likely the latter part of this Ver≈øe ≈øhould be interpreted, <hi>the Daughters ≈øaw her, and the Queens ble≈ø≈øed her, and the Concubines they prai≈øed her.</hi> For though the Jews now have otherwi≈øe di≈øtingui≈øhed the Words, by their Accents; yet <hi>Maimonides</hi> I ob≈øerve di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes them, as I have done, in his Preface to <hi>Seder Zeraim.</hi>

                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> This ≈øome take to be the beginning of a new part of this Song; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar here begins his IVth Book of Commentaries upon it: but I look upon the≈øe Words, as the prai≈øes and commendations, which the <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> before-mentioned, be≈øtow upon the Spou≈øe; with admiration and a≈øtoni≈øhment at her tran≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Beauty.</p>
                     <p>They need no explication, being of known ≈øignification; onely it is fit to note that, to make the Elegy more magnificent, the ≈øpeech grows and encrea≈øes. For though the <hi>morning</hi> be very beautiful and agreeable to every eye; yet the <hi>Moon</hi> is ≈øtill more bright;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46873:194"/>and the <hi>Sun</hi> far brighter than that: but <hi>all the ho≈øt of heaven</hi> (which I take to be meant in the la≈øt Words) ≈øtill more wonderful and amazing. For there being a gradation in this place, and all the other expre≈ø≈øions relating to the heavens, it is rea≈øonable to think that this doth ≈øo too: and that we are to under≈øtand by it the <hi>Armies or Ho≈øt of Heaven</hi> (as the Scripture calls the Stars) rather than Armies upon Earth. However, I have put both into the Paraphra≈øe; but have not medled with my≈øtical applications: They that de≈øire them, may look into the Commentaries of three Fathers, where this Ver≈øe is applied to the four Degrees of Chri≈øtians that are in the Church. Others, with more rea≈øon, apply it to the progre≈øs which the Church her ≈øelf made in ≈øplendor and greatne≈øs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at fir≈øt like the <hi>morning,</hi> when the day breaks, after a long night of ignorance: and then the light of Chri≈øtian Knowledge advanced, till the Church appeared like the <hi>Moon</hi> (who≈øe palene≈øs may ≈øerve for an Emblem of the terrours, which per≈øecution ≈øtruck into their hearts) till, in the i≈ø≈øue, it di≈øper≈øed all mi≈øts, and conquering all oppo≈øition, ≈øhone like the <hi>Sun:</hi> and then was ≈øettled in <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi>'s time like a well-ordered Army, which beat down all Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>They that would ≈øee more of the≈øe applications may look into <hi>Commenius</hi>'s Book <hi>de Bono Unitatis;</hi> in the Beginning whereof there are applications of the≈øe things, both unto the Church in general, and unto particular Churches.</p>

                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> This ≈øeems to be the voice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom declaring what returns He expected to his love.

For which end ≈øhe ≈øeems on a ≈øudden, to take leave of her Friends (who had been ≈øo charitable, as to go along with her to ≈øeek Him) that ≈øhe might, for ≈øome time, enjoy his Company alone: Which is the ground of their calling upon her to return, in the next Ver≈øe.

                     <p>The repetition of the Word <hi>return,</hi> four times over, expre≈ø≈øeth their vehement affection to her, and their

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Feet not being here con≈øidered as naked, in all rea≈øon we ought not to expound the next Words of the naked <hi>Thighs</hi> (the di≈øcovery of which had been immode≈øt) but of the clothing of them round about. For ≈øo that Word we tran≈ølate <hi>Joints</hi> is

                     <p>Which agrees with what follows, <hi>The work of the hands of a cunning Workman.</hi> Where <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> al≈øo ≈øignifies, not any Artificer, but a <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømith,</hi> who (as <hi>Bochart</hi> hath ob≈øerved) made Wires, Laces, Wreaths, Rings, and ≈øuch like little Ornaments of Gold and Silver, as Women u≈øed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphra≈øe applies all this, to the peoples going up three times a year to the publick Fea≈øts: as R. <hi>Solomon</hi> before-named, expounds al≈øo that place in <hi>LII.

Who≈øe ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs herein, may be al≈øo here repre≈øented: though I ≈øee not why it may not as well be applied to Chri≈øtians going cheerfully to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip God in their publick A≈ø≈øemblies.</p>

                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> The Garments, I doubt not, of the≈øe Parts are ≈øtill de≈øcribed in this Ver≈øe.

                     <p>Now in the very mid≈øt of this Work, I conceive there was a <hi>Fountain:</hi> which I take to be the meaning of the fir≈øt Words of the Ver≈øe, <hi>Thy Navel is a round Goblet, which wanteth not Liquor:</hi> that is, <hi>a great Bowl or Ba≈øin, was wrought in the Center of the Embroidery; full of Water, which ran continually from above into it.</hi> Or, a <hi>Conduit, running with ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Liquors, into a great Bowl.</hi> Unto which the Word <hi>hammazog</hi> importing a <hi>mixture</hi>) ≈øeems to incline the ≈øen≈øe.</p>

                        </gap>, as the LXX tran≈ølate it, a <hi>great Bowl</hi> or <hi>Ba≈øin;</hi> is u≈øed by the Chaldee Paraphra≈øt for a receptacle of Water, in Fountains or in Ditches. As in <hi>IV. Judg. 11.</hi> where the <hi>Valley</hi> or Plain of <hi>Agannaja,</hi> of Bowls, which was in <hi>Kede≈øh,</hi> is interpreted by <hi>Kimchi,</hi> the Field in which were many Pits or Trenches, like to Bowls, full of Water.</p>
                     <p>This ≈øeems to be a plainer Interpretation, than that of <hi>Zanchez;</hi> who fan≈øies this to have been ≈øome Jewel, that hung down from her Girdle upon the Navel; which was of this form, round like the Moon. And the Chaldee Paraphra≈øt under≈øtood it to be of this Figure, when he applies it <hi>to the Head of their School, who ≈øhone in the knowledge
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46873:199"/>of the Law, like the Circle of the Moon: and ≈øeventy Wi≈øe men round about him, like a Heap of Wheat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the my≈øtical meaning of this <hi>Hieroglyphick Ve≈øture</hi> (as it may be called) is very hard to ≈øay.

                     <p>The former part of this Ver≈øe is applied by the Chaldee Paraphra≈øt to the <hi>King</hi> (the Head of the people) <hi>who ≈øhall be ju≈øt like</hi> Elias; <hi>who was zealous for the Lord of Ho≈øts, and ≈ølew the fal≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon Mount</hi> Carmel: and the latter part of it to their <hi>poor, who ≈øhall be clothed by him in Purple; as</hi> Daniel <hi>was in</hi> Babylon, <hi>and</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai <hi>in</hi> Shu≈øhan.</p>

                     <p>The fir≈øt Word <hi>fair</hi> may relate to the rare compo≈øition of the whole Body: and the next Word <hi>plea≈øant,</hi> or <hi>≈øweet,</hi> or <hi>comely</hi> (as ≈øome tran≈ølate it) to her graceful motion, ge≈øture, and ≈øweet conver≈øation.

                        <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Note here is very pious; that we become thus beautiful and lovely (though deformed before) by delighting in Charity; and making doing good, our highe≈øt plea≈øure.</p>

                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> This Ver≈øe is a reflection upon the whole foregoing de≈øcription; as appears by the fir≈øt Word <hi>zoth, this:</hi> As if they had ≈øaid, <hi>to all this thy ≈øtature is proportionable.</hi> Which is compared to the <hi>Palm-tree;</hi> becau≈øe it ≈øhoots up ≈øtraight as well as high: and therefore ≈øets forth that part of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46873:201"/>which con≈øi≈øts in tallne≈øs. Which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought a great addition to Beauty; and was one rea≈øon why Women wore Ornaments upon the very top of their Heads, as well as high Shoes, to make them appear the taller. The noble≈øt Palm-trees of all other, were in <hi>Judaea</hi> (e≈øpecially about <hi>Jericho</hi>) as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, L. XIII. C. <hi>4.</hi> From whence it was that in future times, it became an Emblem of that Country: as we find in that Medal of the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> with a Captive Woman ≈øitting under a <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> and the In≈øcription of <hi>Judaea Capta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our learned Country-man, Sir <hi>Tho. Brown</hi> (in his <hi>Mi≈øcellan. Tracts,</hi> p. <hi>78.</hi>) hath ingeniou≈øly ob≈øerved that they ≈øpeak emphatically, when they ≈øay they will <hi>go up to take hold of the Boughs</hi> of this Tree. For it mu≈øt be a≈øcended, before one can come at the Boughs which it bears only at the top and upper parts. But the Trunk or Body of it is naturally contrived, <hi>den≈øis, gradat√≠≈øque corticum pollicibus, ut or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibus</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> there ≈øpeaks) with Rings in the Bark, orderly di≈øpo≈øed, like ≈øteps, whereby it may be very ea≈øily climbed.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Clu≈øters,</hi> to which the Brea≈øts are here compared, ≈øome think, are nothing but the Fruit of this Tree, viz. <hi>Dates:</hi> for it is not expre≈ø≈øed in the Hebrew what <hi>Clu≈øters</hi> the≈øe were; the Word <hi>Grapes</hi> being added by our Tran≈ølators of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>Who ≈øuppo≈øed, as others do, that Vines ran up the Palm-tree in tho≈øe Countries: which agrees well with what follows in the next Ver≈øe, where the <hi>Clu≈øters of the Vine,</hi> are mentioned, as a fit Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of her Brea≈øts. Which were de≈øcribed before, v. <hi>4;</hi> but now mentioned again: to ≈øhow that they lookt not merely at the Beauty, but the u≈øefulne≈øs of that which is meant thereby. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes this pious Ob≈øervation upon it, That <hi>though
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46873:202"/>the Church be de≈øcribed as ≈øublime, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven</hi> (as his Words are) <hi>yet ≈øhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates her ≈øelf to the weake≈øt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Souls: ≈øtretching out the Brea≈øts of her Doctrine to all that need it. For the Bunches of the Palm-tree,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>hang down very low.</hi> Which mu≈øt be under≈øtood, not of their hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down near the Earth, but below the Boughs: which are all at the top, and very high. For which rea≈øon <hi>Menochius</hi> (L. VII. <hi>de Repub. Hebr.</hi> C. VIII. n. X.) thinks it not to be true, which <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> here notes; that the Vines in <hi>Pale≈øtine</hi> were joined unto Palm-trees; becau≈øe the Palm-tree hath not Boughs fit to ≈øupport the Branches of the Vine:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> I take this Ver≈øe to be ≈øtill the voice of the ≈øame per≈øons, though in the Singular Number (as appears from the mention of the <hi>Beloved,</hi> v. <hi>9;</hi> which ≈øhows it is not He that ≈øpeaks here, but ≈øome other per≈øon) For one ≈øpake in the name of the re≈øt; (as <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the name of his other three Brethren, <hi>II. Dan. 30, 36.</hi>) or the whole <hi>Choire</hi> is con≈øidered but as one per≈øon: who de≈øire to have fellow≈øhip and communion with the Church in her Benefits. Of which having ta≈øted, they ≈øay, <hi>now al≈øo thy Brea≈øts ≈øhall be as Clu≈øters of the Vine;</hi> that is, now we ≈øhall enjoy tho≈øe delicious plea≈øures before-mentioned, v. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which we tran≈ølate <hi>No≈øe,</hi> in the la≈øt Clau≈øe of the Ver≈øe, the Vulgar tran≈ølates <hi>countenance</hi> (or <hi>mouth</hi> rather) agreeable enough to the Hebrew; and mo≈øt agreeable to the re≈øt of the Words. For that which is <hi>≈ømelt</hi> is the breath, coming out of the mouth: compared to the fragrancy of <hi>Citrons, Oranges, Peaches,</hi> or other ≈øorts of <hi>tappuach;</hi> which is a name (I ob≈øerved above, <hi>II. 5.</hi>) common to all ≈øuch Fruits, as well as tho≈øe we peculiarly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46873:202"/>call <hi>Apples:</hi> and indeed ≈øignifies any Fruit, that hath a fragrant odour breathing from it.</p>
                     <p>And this may be thus my≈øtically expounded, <hi>And now ≈øhall we delight to hang upon the Brea≈øts of the Church, and the Breath or Spirit of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles; ≈øweeter than Grapes, or the ≈ømell of any other Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> Which is further explained in this Ver≈øe. Where the <hi>roof of the mouth,</hi> i. e. the Words which come from thence, it compared to the mo≈øt excellent Wine: which was ≈øo choice, that it was fit only to be pre≈øented to him, to who≈øe love they owed all they had (or ≈øo delicious, as our Tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath it, that it went down glibly) and ≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, that it put ≈øpirits into tho≈øe who were quite ≈øpent with Age; nay, rai≈øed tho≈øe who were, in a manner, dead. So this Character of the <hi>be≈øt Wine</hi> runs word for word, in the Hebrew: <hi>It goeth ≈øtraight to my Beloved, and cau≈øeth to ≈øpeak, the lips of old people, or of tho≈øe that ≈øleep:</hi> that is, are dead. For this Word <hi>Je≈øchenim,</hi> our Tran≈ølators thought, may either ≈øignifie, <hi>old men,</hi> or <hi>men a≈øleep:</hi> though exact Grammarians will not allow it; but make a great difference between <hi>je≈øche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi> and <hi>Je≈øchanim.</hi> The fir≈øt of which (which is the word here) they ≈øay, never ≈øignifies old men, but only <hi>Sleepers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if we wave this nice di≈øtinction, the Words may al≈øo be thus tran≈ølated ‚Äî <hi>which makes men ≈øpeak with the lips of the antient,</hi> i. e. Sentences, or mo≈øt excellent Sayings. I omit other Glo≈ø≈øes, which may be found every where.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> Here now the ≈øpou≈øe, after long ≈øilence, puts an end to their <hi>Encomium:</hi> mode≈øtly acknowledging there was nothing in her that could de≈øerve it; but only as ≈øhe was His, who could not be prai≈øed enough.</p>
                     <p>

The Words, in effect, we have met withal twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>II. 16.

                     <p>So the ≈øen≈øe of this Ver≈øe is, that they found more there than they expected: or, that by her care the mo≈øt excellent Fruit was produced from people of the be≈øt rank (who may be under≈øtood by this mo≈øt rare ≈øort of Fruit) and that, every where: ≈øo that they needed not to be at the trouble to go far to gather it.

Rom. 25.</hi> Which the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith there, v. <hi>15.</hi> would be <hi>life from the dead:</hi> Unto which the la≈øt Words of this Ver≈øe may be accommodated.</p>
                     <p>For after ≈øhe had ≈øaid ≈øhe <hi>would lead him,</hi> or <hi>bring him down;</hi> and then <hi>bring him into the hou≈øe</hi> of her Mother; ≈øhe adds, <hi>thou ≈øhalt teach,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtru≈øt me.</hi> Which agrees with what the Apo≈øtle there writes, v. <hi>12.</hi> that if the fall of the Jews was <hi>the riches of the Gentiles;</hi> that is, enriched them with the Trea≈øures of Divine Wi≈ødom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how much more would their fullne≈øs inrich them? If we referr this Clau≈øe (as we do) to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> before-named, the be≈øt ≈øen≈øe I can make of it is this, <hi>By whom I was educated and in≈øtructed.</hi> And then follows her making Him <hi>drink of ≈øpiced Wine</hi> (that is, making a great Fea≈øt for Him, <hi>IX. Prov. 2.</hi> where the mo≈øt excellent Wine made the chiefe≈øt part of the Entertainment) ≈øuch Wine as makes tho≈øe who are a≈øleep to ≈øpeak, <hi>VII. 9.</hi> Which effect, the receiving of the Jews again will produce; as the Apo≈øtle tells us, when he ≈øaith, <hi>it ≈øhall be life from the dead:</hi> i. e. a mo≈øt powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enliven the most stupid Souls, and move them to believe in Christ.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is that <hi>Harekach, ≈øpiced</hi> or <hi>Aromatick Wine,</hi> denotes its fragrancy or delicious odour; whereby the best Wines are di≈øcerned, as much as by their taste: and the Word we tran≈ølate <hi>Juice</hi> ≈øignifies every where, <hi>Mu≈øte</hi> or <hi>new Wine:</hi> whereby the Prophets ≈øet forth ≈øomething that works with greater power and efficacy than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>IX. Zach. 17.</hi> And here, I doubt not, relates to ≈øomething new and unu≈øual: and, in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Application, may ≈øignifie a greater fullne≈øs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46873:208"/>and power of the Spirit, than had been in former days; working like new Wine in the hearts of tho≈øe that received the Go≈øpel.</p>
                     <p>All this is ≈øaid to be done to <hi>Him,</hi> becau≈øe, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> noted before, what is done to his Members, he takes as done to him≈øelf.</p>

                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> Who is here repre≈øented, as immediately conde≈øcending to her de≈øires, and fulfilling her wi≈øhes: vouch≈øafing a new ≈øupply of the power of the Spirit, to ≈øupport and comfort her in tho≈øe labours of love for his names ≈øake.

                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> This Ver≈øe hath al≈øo been twice u≈øed before; with no difference from what we read here, but that now the mention of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Roes</hi> is left out; and yet he charges them with greater vehemence than ever. For the Hebrew Phra≈øe here ≈øignifies, as much as <hi>what do you do? why do you ≈øtir,</hi> &amp;c. that is, by no means; take heed how you di≈øturb her. See <hi>II. 7. III. 5.</hi>

Which ≈øignifies her advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto a ≈øtate of greater dearne≈øs to Him, and familiarity with Him.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>mithrappeketh,</hi> is not found el≈øewhere, and therefore variou≈øly tran≈ølated by Interpreters. But mo≈øt agree that it ≈øignifies, either clo≈øely <hi>adhering,</hi> or <hi>leaning, relying,</hi> and <hi>recumbring,</hi> as they ≈øpeak: which <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> hath ≈øhown is the u≈øe of the Word in Neighbouring Languages. But there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46873:209"/>are tho≈øe who think it imports ≈øomething of plea≈øure (and therefore the <hi>Vulgar</hi> takes in that ≈øen≈øe with the other; as I have in the Paraphra≈øe) and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølate it <hi>flowing with the delights.</hi> For ≈øhe having been in the Fields and Villages, vi≈øiting the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and other places <hi>(VII. 11, 12, 13.)</hi> is now introduced as coming back from thence, into the Royal City. Which being ≈øeated on high, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon with the Plains out of which ≈øhe came, ≈øhe is ≈øaid to <hi>a≈øcend,</hi> or <hi>come up:</hi> but that ≈øhe might not be tired with the Journey, is repre≈øented as <hi>leaning upon the arm of her Beloved</hi> (or as ≈øome will have it, <hi>lying in his bo≈øom,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> did in our Saviours) and laden with the delicious fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned <hi>(VII. 13.)</hi> Which excited the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that knew her, when they beheld the Grace of her Lord towards her; together with her own Beauty, Riches, Ornaments, and Happine≈øs.</p>
                     <p>The latter part of the Ver≈øe, all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers take to be the voice of the Bridegroom; and ≈øo do many of the <hi>Latines.</hi> But ≈øome of them, and all the Hebrew Writers take them to be the Words of the Spou≈øe; becau≈øe <hi>thee</hi> is of the Ma≈øculine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Which ≈øoever way we take them, the ≈øen≈øe is very hard to find. If we go the fir≈øt way, the mo≈øt natural ≈øen≈øe ≈øeems to be, that He puts her in mind of the poor and mean condition, out of which He had taken her, into a ≈øtate of the greate≈øt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip with Him: that ≈øhe might not be vainly puft up, with the acclamations which were made to her.</p>
                     <p>But I have followed the Hebrew Points, in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphra≈øe, and under≈øtood the Words of <hi>≈øtirring up his love towards her,</hi> when they were looking after the Plantations mentioned, <hi>VII. 11, 12.</hi> Which was excited by the care and pains ≈øhe took in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs; like the pains of a Woman in travail: unto which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compares the ≈øolicitude and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46873:209"/>care he had about the Galatians, that <hi>Chri≈øt might be formed in them. IV. 19.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certain it is that <hi>chibbel√°h</hi> is a Word which relates to the pangs of travailing Women, and therefore the LXX tran≈ølate it <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: ≈øo that if I have not conjectured ami≈øs about the re≈øt, my interpretation of the la≈øt Words is natural enough. For <hi>Caph ≈øimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis</hi> (as they call it) is frequently omitted in the Scripture, and to be ≈øupplied by the ≈øen≈øe. Twice in this very Book it is wanting, <hi>I. 15. VII. 4. thy eyes are Doves,</hi> that is, <hi>as Doves:</hi> and in <hi>XVII. Prov. 21.</hi> and in his Father <hi>David</hi>'s P≈øalms very often, <hi>XI. P≈øal. 1. How ≈øay you to my ≈øoul, flee a bird,</hi> i. e. as a Bird, <hi>to your hill:</hi> and to omit other places, <hi>CXIX. 119. Thou putte≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the wicked of the earth, dro≈øs,</hi> i. e. <hi>as</hi> or <hi>like</hi> dro≈øs.</p>
                     <p>In like manner I take the la≈øt Words of this Ver≈øe, <hi>there</hi> (viz. I ≈øtirred thee up) <hi>as thy mother travailed in birth with thee,</hi> there, <hi>I ≈øay, like her that brought thee forth:</hi> i. e. by ≈øuch pains as the≈øe I rai≈øed up thy love to me.</p>
                     <p>As for what is ≈øaid by many Interpreters, concerning <hi>Eve</hi>'s eating the Apple in Paradi≈øe, and thereby ruining all mankind; there is no rea≈øon to think, either that ≈øhe is the <hi>Mother</hi> here meant, or that <hi>Tappuach</hi> denotes an <hi>Apple,</hi> rather than <hi>Orange, Citron</hi> or ≈øuch like Fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> The≈øe Words al≈øo, according to the Hebrew Points, are the Words of the Spou≈øe; be≈øeeching her Beloved to keep her always in his mind, as one very dear to Him. For that was the end of having the Name, or the Picture of a beloved per≈øon, engraven on a <hi>Seal,</hi> or <hi>Jewel,</hi> and wearing it next the heart, or upon the arm; that it might te≈øtifie their great e≈øteem of ≈øuch per≈øons, and the con≈øtancy of their affection towards them, and that they de≈øired they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46873:210"/>might never ≈ølip out of their memory. See <hi>XXII. Jer. 24.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some think here is an allu≈øion to the High Prie≈øt; who carried the names of the Children of I≈ørael, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in Precious Stones, not only upon his Brea≈øt, but upon his Shoulders al≈øo; as may be ≈øeen, <hi>XXVIII.

Ecclus. 11.</hi> who ≈øaith, <hi>Aaron was adorned with Precious Stones, graven like Seals</hi>) And they think withal, that <hi>Seal upon the heart</hi> relates to the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>Seal on the arm,</hi> to the outward expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love and e≈øteem.</p>
                     <p>And then follows the rea≈øon of this Prayer; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the vehemence of her love, which was grown to the heighth of jealou≈øie (which is nothing but the highe≈øt degree of love) le≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould lo≈øe Him, as ≈øhe had been in danger before, <hi>V. 6, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>There is no difficulty but in the la≈øt Clau≈øe of the Ver≈øe (for <hi>as ≈øtrong as death,</hi> ≈øignifies it to be in≈øuperable; ≈øo <hi>cruel as the grave,</hi> denotes it not to be moved by prayers, and entreaties, or any thing el≈øe.)

                     <p>Some tran≈ølate it, <hi>Such flames are kindled only by the Lord.</hi> And then, if there be an allu≈øion to the Brea≈øt-plate of the High Prie≈øt, in the beginning of the Ver≈øe, I fan≈øie the conclu≈øion may allude to the <hi>fire that went out from before the Lord</hi> (<hi>IX.</hi> Lev. <hi>24.</hi> and devoured the Sacrifices, as Love doth all manner of difficulties.

                     <p>By <hi>many waters</hi> are ≈øometimes meant, in Scripture, <hi>many afflictions</hi> (as is very well known) which they that love, frequently endure, before they can accompli≈øh their de≈øire.

                     <p>And ≈øuch is its con≈øtancy, and ≈øatisfaction al≈øo which it hath in its own plea≈øures, it regards not riches at all; but will rather be poor with one whom it affects, than enjoy great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions with another per≈øon. Nay, it de≈øpi≈øes, and that with di≈ødain, the offers of a mans whole E≈øtate; if that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be impo≈øed, of for≈øaking its love. Others may laugh, perhaps, at ≈øuch per≈øons; but, it is all one, they ≈ømile at them again. So <hi>Theodoret</hi> and the LXX under≈øtand the latter part of this Ver≈øe, <hi>if a man give away all his ≈øub≈øtance in Charity, they will extremely de≈øpi≈øe him.</hi> That is, ≈øaith he, they that ≈øpend all they have, and their very lives, for the love of God, are ≈øet at nought by tho≈øe that want ≈øuch love.

                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Here is another property of Divine love, which makes us ≈øolicitous for tho≈øe that want it; or have but the beginnings of it, and may be in danger to lo≈øe them. And this ≈øeems to be the Speech of the Spou≈øe to her Companions, who were all troubled for a <hi>Si≈øter</hi> (that is, ≈øome Church) which was of a ≈ømall growth, and had <hi>no Brea≈øts;</hi> that is, was not ripe for Marriage. For all have Brea≈øts; but they do not ri≈øe and ≈øwell, till they are of ≈øuch an Age, that they may be called <hi>Women, XVI. Ezek.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46873:211"/>7.</hi> They enquire therefore what they ≈øhould do for her, <hi>in the day when ≈øhe ≈øhall be ≈øpoken for?</hi> that is, demanded in marriage.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> Here He returns an An≈øwer to that Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is, that He and they will take the greater care for her; to rai≈øe her ≈øtature, and to bring her to perfection. For where there are good beginnings, we are not wont to for≈øake them: but rather to add to them and improve them. As for example, the Wall of a Building which we e≈øteem, we do not ≈øuffer to fall to the ground, but ≈øtrengthen and rai≈øe it: nay, adorn it ≈øometimes and beautifie it with Towres and Pinnacles; which we ≈øtick not to gild, that they may appear more gloriou≈øly. Or if it be a Door of a Hou≈øe, which we value, we let it not decay; but rather ca≈øe it with Boards of <hi>Cedar,</hi> to make it more durable, as well as neat and hand≈øome: for <hi>Cedar</hi> is not apt to putrefie.</p>
                     <p>This ≈øeems to me the mo≈øt ≈øimple Expo≈øition of the≈øe Words; and I do not think fit to trouble the Reader with that va≈øt variety, which may be found in Interpreters. But only add, that they may very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be applied unto a Soul, or a Church in a ≈øtate of imperfection; but built upon Chri≈øt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in this manner, <hi>Let her but be firm and con≈øtant, like a Wall, in her love to me, and I will not abandon the care of her; let her but exclude all other, and open to me alone, and ≈øhe ≈øhall never want any thing nece≈ø≈øary to her perfection: for I will richly adorn her, and make her like the Hou≈øe of God Him≈øelf; which is lined with Cedar.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> Where ≈øhe ≈øaith ≈øhe will her ≈øelf look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vineyard committed to her tru≈øt; and not leave it to the care of others. Which ≈øeems to be the meaning of the fir≈øt Phra≈øe in this Ver≈øe, <hi>My Vineyard which I have is before me,</hi> i.e. is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my eye (as we ≈øpeak) and ≈øpecial care. Thus God's Judgments are ≈øaid to be before <hi>David, XVIII. P≈øal. 22.</hi> that is, He took great care never to ≈øwerve from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:46873:212"/>
It amounts al≈øo to the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, if we take this Phra≈øe to ≈øignifie as much, as <hi>it is in my power, XLVII. Gen. 5. XL. Jer. 4.</hi> For then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, ≈øhe kept it in her own hand, or occupation; and did not farm it out to others.</p>
                     <p>And then the la≈øt part of the Ver≈øe ≈øignifies, that if <hi>Solomon</hi> made ≈øuch a profit of his Vineyard, as that before-named (be≈øides <hi>two hundred</hi> Shekels; which each of the Farmers got over and above for their pains) though he did not dre≈øs it him≈øelf; what would be the encrea≈øe, that ≈øhe was likely to make by her own care and diligence in the bu≈øine≈øs. That is, it was incredible what fruit ≈øhe would reap by her pains: according to that of the Son of <hi>Syrach, XXIV. Ecclus 31, &amp;c. I ≈øaid I will water my be≈øt Garden, and I will water abundantly my Garden-Bed, and lo, my Brook became a River, and my River became Sea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This ≈øeems to me the mo≈øt natural ≈øen≈øe of the≈øe two difficult Ver≈øes; which <hi>Almonazir</hi> ≈øugge≈øted to my thoughts. And that <hi>Solomon,</hi> not any other per≈øon, is here intended, <hi>Maimonides</hi> him≈øelf agrees; who in his Treati≈øe of the <hi>Foundation of the Law,</hi> C. VII. hath the≈øe Words: <hi>Where≈øoever you meet with the name of</hi> Solomon, <hi>in the Book of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <hi>it is holy; as the re≈øt of the names there are: ≈øave only in that place, a thou≈øand are to thee, O Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. Others al≈øo add that place, <hi>III. Cant. 7. Behold the Bed which is Solomons,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Ma≈øters ≈øay, it is a common name, as well as here.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe two Ver≈øes are ingeniou≈øly applied by ≈øome, to the far greater encrea≈øe of knowledge and goodne≈øs in the <hi>Church,</hi> than in the <hi>Synagogue:</hi> that is by Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, than by Judai≈øm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> This Ver≈øe, according to the Hebrew Points, is the voice of the <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> who ≈øeems
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46873:213"/>to commend the re≈øolution ≈øhe made, in the foregoing Ver≈øe. And he calling her <hi>the inhabitant of the gardens</hi> (which are the ≈øame with the <hi>Vineyard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) it ≈øignifies her perpetual care about their pro≈øperity. In recompence of which He bids her, before they fini≈øh this interview, to ask what ≈øhe will of Him, and it ≈øhall be done for her. Which, in ≈øhort, is the ≈øumm of what the ≈øame <hi>Almonazir</hi> hath long ago conjectured to be the ≈øen≈øe of this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14]</hi> Unto which ≈øhe returns her An≈øwer, in the≈øe Words; and ≈øo ≈øhuts up this Song. Which ≈øeems to me to conclude as it begun; with a de≈øire that the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah</hi> would come, and make good all tho≈øe things, that had been repre≈øented in the≈øe rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>berach,</hi> which we tran≈ølate <hi>make ha≈øte,</hi> is twice tran≈ølated by the LXX <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The <hi>young hart</hi> (called here <hi>opher</hi>) is ≈øtill more ≈øwift and nimble than the old: the exceeding great fear wherein it is, adding Wings (as we ≈øpeak) to its feet.

                     </p>
                     <p>Who well ob≈øerves (L. III. C. XVII. Part. <hi>1. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi>) that the ≈øen≈øe of the la≈øt Words (<hi>upon the mountains,</hi> &amp;c.) is to be made out by adding one Word, in this manner, <hi>Be thou like the young
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46873:213"/>Harts running</hi> (or <hi>when they run</hi>) <hi>upon the mountains of ≈øpices,</hi> i. e. the Mountains where Spices grow; ≈øuch as tho≈øe mentioned <hi>IV. 6.</hi> Such perhaps was <hi>Bether, II. 17.</hi> (where we meet with the≈øe Words before) and I have ≈øometime thought, that they ≈øhould be ≈øo tran≈ølated here, <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Be≈øamim;</hi> as there the Mountains of <hi>Bether.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what the≈øe Mountains were we are now ignorant though this is certain, that the Creatures here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were bred in the highe≈øt Mountains of the Country; as <hi>Aelian</hi> te≈øtifies in the latter end of his <hi>fifth</hi> Book: <hi>The Harts in</hi> Syria <hi>are bred in their highe≈øt Mountains,</hi> Amanus, Libanus, <hi>and</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. For there they were ≈øafe≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øecure from danger; there it was difficult to pur≈øue them, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they climbed up the ≈øteepe≈øt places. And therefore the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> when they would repre≈øent them≈øelves as in a ≈øtate of perfect ≈øecurity, ≈øay God had <hi>made their feet like hinds feet, and made them to walk upon their (bamoth) high places, XVIII. P≈øal. 33. III. Hab.</hi> ult. Which Words allude to the inacce≈ø≈øible Mountains, which tho≈øe Creatures frequented; e≈øpecially the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, that they might there ≈øecure their young ones. Be≈øides, as there they could feed and bring forth their young mo≈øt ≈øecurely; ≈øo there was the ≈øweete≈øt feeding.</p>
                     <p>In ≈øhort, <hi>Solomon</hi> here ≈øeems to long for the fir≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> doth for his la≈øt: who concludes his Book of the Revelation in the ≈øame manner as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth this: ≈øaying, <hi>Come, Lord Je≈øus, XXII.

                     </p>
                     <p>There are tho≈øe who fan≈øie that in the foregoing Ver≈øe the Bridegroom asks her con≈øent, for the perfecting their love in Marriage; and de≈øires her in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her Companions to lift up her voice and ≈øing
