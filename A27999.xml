            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>WE ſee in Your Lordſhip ſuch a plain and familiar Example of that Wiſdom which <hi>SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON</hi> preaches in the Book of <hi>EC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLESIASTES,</hi> that I am invited thereby to this boldneſs of prefixing Your Lordſhip's Name before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe I have made upon it, and upon the Book that follows it.</p>
                  <p>A Wiſdom, which hath raiſed Your Mind above the deceitfulneſs of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of all Worldly Glories: a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, which hath raiſed You above your ſelf; and made the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice of God, and of the King, the ſole ſcope of all Your Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>It is a token ſurely of the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards us, and ought to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb facs="tcp:46873:3"/>among the felicities of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's Reign, that a Vertue ſo active and laborious in doing good, is placed in ſuch a wide and capacious Sphere, as that wherein Your Lordſhip moves. From whence Your influences are no leſs powerful than they are benign: ſtirring us up to induſtry, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, by Your own great Example, to do our Duties uprightly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly in our ſeveral Stations.</p>
                  <p>Some ſmall ſervice I hope I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Explication of theſe two holy Books. In the firſt of which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient Opinion) the foundation is laid for a due progreſs unto the other: the Mind not being fitted for ſuch ſublime thoughts, as lye hid under the Figures, in the Book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> till it hath learnt by the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi> the vanity of all earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; and, by looking down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with contempt, be diſpoſed to value heavenly Bleſſings. To this
<pb facs="tcp:46873:3"/>purpoſe <hi>Origen</hi> diſcourſes in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Song of Songs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a Depth into which I have adventured to dive, though it hath been famous, as one ſpeaks, for the ſhipwrack of many great Pilots: who went too far, as I conceive, and ſought for more there than is to be found; and therefore miſcarried. Which Rock I have carefully avoided; and ſteered my Courſe by ſuch a clear and certain Direction (which I thought I eſpied in other holy Writings) that if I have kept my eye ſtedfaſtly fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I am ſatisfied hath not miſled me, but carried me to the right ſenſe of this admirable Piece of Divine Poetry.</p>
                  <p>Which I truſt I have made ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if the Readers will ſeriouſly conſider the Riſe and Ground I have taken for my Expoſition: even they who have made bold to prophane this Book with their wanton imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will hereafter look upon it with reverence.</p>

                  <p>Praying God to continue Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a long Bleſſing to this Church, by Your prudent, ſteady and obliging Conduct, in the Government of us, who have the happineſs to be under Your particular care; I remain,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> THis Book not carrying in the front of it the expreſs Name of <hi>SOLOMON,</hi> it hath emboldned ſome to take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of intitling other Authors to it. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for inſtance, whom the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> make to ſpeak thoſe Words in the entrance of it, <hi>The words of the Preacher,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as R. <hi>Moſes Kimchi,</hi> with ſome other Jews, fanſie: Or, to name no more, <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> whom <hi>Grotius</hi> (in his Notes upon Chap. <hi>XII. 11.</hi>) conjectures to have appointed certain men to make this <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For ſo he would have the word <hi>COHELETH</hi> tranſlated, a <hi>Collector;</hi> or Heaper up of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rather than a <hi>Preacher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> But there are ſo many paſſages in the Book which agree to none but <hi>Solomon,</hi> that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great a man as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhould be led away from the common Opinion, by ſuch ſlight reaſons, as I ſhall preſently mention. For inſtance, there never was any Body that could truly ſpeak thoſe words which we read v. <hi>16.</hi> of the firſt Chapter, but only <hi>Solomon.</hi> For neither <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> nor <hi>Joſiah,</hi> nor <hi>Zorobabel</hi> kept ſuch great State, as he did, much leſs excelled him in Wiſdom. And who but he could boaſt of ſuch things as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="tcp:46873:5"/>Chap. II. v. <hi>4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</hi> to repreſent the ſplendour wherein he lived, above all that had been before him in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Or, on the contrary, Who had ſuch reaſon as he, to make that ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (Chap. VII. <hi>26, &amp;c.</hi>) of the miſchief he had received by Women? And to omit the reſt, thoſe words in the laſt Chapter, v. <hi>9, 10.</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none but him, who <hi>ſet in order</hi> many <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as appears in the foregoing Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> Which things are ſo convincing, that <hi>Grotius</hi> is forced to acknowledge that <hi>Zorobabel</hi> cauſed this Book to be compoſed in the Name of King <hi>Solomon</hi> (for he was no King himſelf, but a Governour under the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>) repenting of his former vain and ſinful life. Which very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment carries in it a plain ſolution of the principal Argument, whereby he was led to this odd Opinion: Which is, that he finds ſome words in this Book, that are no where to be met withal, but in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Which makes it probable, he thinks, that it was written after their Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But ſuppoſing <hi>Solomon</hi> to write here as a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, after he had frequented the Company of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Outlandiſh Women (of whom we read <hi>1 Kings</hi> XI. <hi>1, 2.</hi>) it need not ſeem ſtrange to us that he had learnt the uſe of many of their words. And ſo, notwithſtanding this Objection, he may ſtill be thought to have been the Author of this Book himſelf: which the Hebrews generally conceive to have been written by him, towards the end of his Reign; after he had tried all manner of pleaſures,
<pb facs="tcp:46873:5"/>even to an exceſs. Beſides, in other Books of Scripture there are words, for the ſignification of which we are fain to have reſort unto other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and particularly the <hi>Arabick;</hi> becauſe they are not to be found elſewhere in the Scripture: and yet, for all that, might be pure Hebrew, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the language which was then ſpoken, when ſuch Books were written.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> But it is not fit to ſtay any longer, in the confutation of ſuch a weak reaſon as this; which hath no force in it (though it be the beſt he hath) to make us think of any other Author of this Book, than <hi>Solomon.</hi> Who, if he did not write it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf it is certain ſpake the things contained in it: and calls himſelf the <hi>PREACHER,</hi> becauſe of the great gravity and dignity of the Subject, whereof he treats; of which he was wont to ſpeak frequently (Chap. XII. <hi>9.</hi>) deſiring it might be underſtood and laid to heart, by the <hi>whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> of Iſrael; as the Word <hi>Coheleth</hi> ſeems to import; which in the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> language ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Circle,</hi> or a Company of men gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the form of a <hi>Circle,</hi> as <hi>Ludolphus</hi> hath lately obſerved. For the ſcope of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is concerning the <hi>chief Good</hi> or happineſs of man: the <hi>great end</hi> he ſhould propoſe to himſelf all his life long. Which is not that, he ſhows, which men generally follow: but that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neglected. For moſt men mind nothing, but juſt what is before them: which they will find at laſt, as he had done by ſad experience, to be mere vanity; utterly unable to quiet their minds.
<pb facs="tcp:46873:6"/>Which muſt therefore ſeek for ſatisfaction in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; and, after all their buſie thoughts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and labours come to this Concluſion, that to <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments,</hi> is the happineſs of man: who ought therefore to uſe all the pleaſures of this World (which is the only Good it can afford us) with a conſtant reſpect to the future account, we muſt all make to God.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V.</hi> This, it appears by the beginning and the end of this Book, is the Scope of it. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which they that will not attend, are wont to pick out here and there a looſe Sentence, which agrees with their deſires; and then pleaſe themſelves with a fancy that they have got <hi>Solomon</hi> on their ſide, to help to maintain their infidelity: Not conſidering what he aſſerts directly contrary, in other places. Where he preſſes the greateſt and moſt ſerious reverence to Almighty God, IV. <hi>17.</hi> V. <hi>1, 2,</hi> &amp;c.

All which plainly ſhew, that thoſe words which ſeem to countenance men in their neglect of Religion, and open a Gap to licentiouſneſs, are only Opinions which he intends to confute, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he had propounded to himſelf in this Book. Wherein he firſt repreſents the various ends men drive at; which in the very entrance of it (that men might not miſtake his meaning) he pronounces
<pb facs="tcp:46873:6"/>to be ſo vain; that he had not words ſignificant enough to expreſs their vanity; and then, their different Opinions about God, and his Providence, and their own ſouls: and what thoughts he himſelf had toſſed up and down in his mind; which at laſt came to that reſolution I mentioned before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ends his Book. In the cloſe of which, to give the greater weight unto what he had ſaid, he adds this: That theſe were not only the reſult of his own thoughts, but the judgment of other Wiſe men, with whom he had conſulted.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore deceive himſelf (to uſe the grave words of <hi>Caſtalio</hi>) as ſome, I wiſh I could ſay a few, have done: who not minding the end and drift of this Book, but having met with ſome one place in it that ſeems to favour their beloved luſts, lay hold on that Scrap alone; and with that endeavour to defend their licentious courſe of life. As if they expected, they ſhould find God juſt ſuch a Judge hereafter, as they are of themſelves at preſent.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>VI.</hi> To compriſe all in a few words. The ſenſe of the whole <hi>Sermon,</hi> as we may call it, ſeems to be comprehended in this Syllogiſm,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever is vain and periſhing cannot make men happy;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But all mens deſigns here in this World are vain and periſhing:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore, They cannot by proſecuting ſuch deſigns make themſelves happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Propoſition is evident in it ſelf; and needs no Proof. The Aſſumption therefore he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:46873:7"/>in the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt Chapters, by an enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Particulars; as I ſhall ſhew in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before, or Annotations upon, each Chapter: And then proceeds, in the reſt of the Book, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe men unto the beſt courſe to make themſelves happy; evidently proving all along from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and vanity of all things here, that he who wiſhes well to himſelf, ought to raiſe his mind above them, to the Creator of the World: and, expecting to give an account to Him, ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean himſelf in the uſe of all earthly enjoyments, that he devoutly acknowledge his Divine Majeſty, fearing, and worſhipping Him, and doing his Will.</p>
                  <p>Such indeed is the dulneſs of Mankind, that, hearing all was but vanity, they might condemn every thing as evil and hurtful; and declaim too bitterly againſt this World. Which was ſo far from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s intention, that having explained the vanity of all our injoyments here, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humane cares, ſolicitous deſires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; he perſwades all men to be content with things preſent, to give God thanks for them, to uſe them freely with quiet minds: living as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and taking as much liberty, as the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a future account will allow; void of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and troubleſome thoughts, what will become of them hereafter in this life.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>VII.</hi> But it may not be amiſs perhaps to give a larger account of this <hi>Sermon;</hi> and let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſee in what method it proceeds. For many men imagine it to be a confuſed Diſcourſe, which doth
<pb facs="tcp:46873:7"/>not hang together: and therefore have explained this Book, only by giving an account of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each Verſe; as if it were a diſtinct Sentence, independant on the reſt; like thoſe in his <hi>Proverbs.</hi> But <hi>Antonius Corranus,</hi> a moſt excellent perſon, in a ſmall Diſcourſe of his upon this Book, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten above an hundred years ago; hath drawn ſuch a Scheme of it, as I believe will ſatisfie thoſe who conſider it, that <hi>Solomon</hi> proceeds after an exact order, to deduce what he intended. And therefore I will tranſlate the ſenſe of what he ſaith, into Engliſh; which is to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> The deſign of the Author is to find out and to ſhew, What it is, in which the chief good and compleat felicity of man doth conſiſt. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that reflecting upon various things in which men place their happineſs; at the end of his Diſcourſe upon every one of them, he rejects them as utterly inſufficient for that purpoſe: but continues his ſearch ſo far till at laſt he finds it, and declares in the concluding <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> that he had been ſeeking it, through the whole Diſcourſe, ſaying, the ſumm of the matter is this, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are two principal Parts of the whole <hi>Sermon,</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of which contains a recital, and confutation, of mens falſe Opinions about their Chiefeſt Good: the <hi>other</hi> teaches, in what our genuine, true and ſolid felicity lies; both in this life, and in the next. In both he ſhows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deligently, what is the end to which a man ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:46873:8"/>direct all his Counſels, Studies and Endeavours, what he ought to follow, as moſt deſirable above all things; and what to avoid, as the extreameſt of evils.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe he treats in his <hi>VI.</hi> firſt Chapters; of the other in as many more that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Which is both a perſpicuous and exact me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. For being to treat of felicity, it was but fitting he ſhould divide it into <hi>falſe,</hi> and <hi>true;</hi> and then define aright what that true felicity is. For we muſt firſt ſhun that which is evil, and then purſue that which is good: according to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent admonitions we meet withal in the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <head>The firſt Part.</head>
                     <p n="9">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> Now the firſt part of his Sermon relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Propoſition, which no body denies, <hi>viz.</hi> That vain, frail and troubleſome things cannot make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man happy: And ſuch ſaith he in the very firſt words of the Book, are all things here, <hi>Vanity of Vanities; i. e.</hi> extremely vain.</p>
                     <p>Which Aſſumption it may ſeem hard to prove, if we conſider what account blind Mortals make of their own inventions, counſels, ſtudies and labours, by which they think to attain felicity. But to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> nothing was more eaſie; who having made a full and long experiment of all enjoyments here, moſt evidently demonſtrates this by an enumeration of Parts, and that in an apt, perſpicuous, and compendious order. For he neither confounds the
<pb facs="tcp:46873:8"/>parts; nor too curiouſly purſues them; nor menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all the falſe Opinions of men about the chiefeſt Good (which would have been too tedious, if like <hi>Varro</hi> he had told us of <hi>two hundred, eighty five,</hi> and yet that he could not reckon all) but reducing the moſt probable Opinions unto <hi>four</hi> principal Heads, he confutes them by various Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; drawn chiefly from adjuncts and effects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is of thoſe who place Bleſſedneſs in the knowledge of natural things, and in humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which begins at the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Verſe of the <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter, and reaches to the beginning of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> For in the precedent Verſes, he only lays a foundation for his Diſcourſe, and plains his way to the proof of what he intended.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is of thoſe who place it in pleaſure; which he diſpatches, as unworthy of a long confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the three firſt Verſes of the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But there being thoſe of this Sect, who join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two together, <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> imagine they will make up a complete happineſs; he ſpends more time in ſhowing their Vanity; from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter, to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>third:</hi> interpoſing only a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> wherein he compares <hi>Wiſdom</hi> with <hi>Folly;</hi> and from the effects of both ſhews how much the former is to be preferred before the latter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> touches thoſe who think Honours, Magiſtracies, and Power in the Commonwealth, to be the higheſt of all Goods. In which number are they, who ſeek to extend their Empire, though it be by a vaſt effuſion of their own Subjects blood;
<pb facs="tcp:46873:9"/>by which means alſo they eſtabliſh their tyranny. when they have acquired it. Which diſputation reaches from the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>third</hi> Chapter, to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>fifth.</hi> Yet ſo, that from the beginning of the <hi>fourth</hi> Chapter to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the ſame, he inſerts the miſeries that grow from ſuch tyrannical adminiſtration; and the Vices which break in, upon the impunity of evil Doers, and neglect of the Laws. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he gives us a lively deſcription, of <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs:</hi> two of the fouleſt and moſt cruel peſts of the Commonwealth. In the <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter alſo he inſerts a Diſcourſe of that ſuperſtitious and vain Worſhip of God; in which ſome, deſpiſing all other things, place their ſatisfaction: and moſt lamentably applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it. Which Diſputation contains in it ſome excellent Precepts of true Religion and Piety; which the Reader may find, in the firſt <hi>eight</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter.</p>
                     <p>After which follows the <hi>fourth</hi> Opinion of thoſe who propound to themſelves Riches and Wealth as their laſt end: which if they can attain, they doubt not they ſhall live very happily. Which extends it ſelf from thence to the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Chapter; where you have the general <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of the <hi>firſt Part,</hi> concerning falſe felicity.</p>

                     <p n="10">
                        <hi>X.</hi> Then follows the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and moſt Elegant as well as uſeful part of the Sermon. In which
<pb facs="tcp:46873:9"/>he teaches, that the felicity, for which men take ſo much pains (every one going his own way to it) is not to be found any where, but in a religious and ſerious fear of God: according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that fear the Lord; that walk in his ways;</hi> and again, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord; that delighteth greatly in his Commandments.</hi> For other things; though they promiſe felicity, yet they cannot perform it; becauſe they have ſuch a mixture of vanity, trouble and grief with them, as will not ſuffer them to be abſolutely good; and becauſe, if they were ſincere, yet they being ſo uncertain that they may be loſt before we dye, and at the beſt are terminated within the narrow Bounds of this ſhort life; they cannot give that ſatisfaction and quiet of mind, which we deſire. But the fear of God is ſuch a Good that it both gives true contentment, ſatisfaction and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, as long as we live; and when we die, fills us with a ſure hope of a better life: in which true and genuine felicity is accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>For the ſumm of what can be ſaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be reduced to this Argumentation:</p>
                     <p>That which can make a mans mind quiet, ſtill and calm, both in life and death; that alone can make him happy;</p>
                     <p>Now this the Fear of the Lord can do for him, and this alone:</p>
                     <p>Therefore this, and nothing elſe, will make him a happy man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:46873:10"/>
The Propoſition needs no Proof; For then we feel our ſelves happy, when our minds are ſo quiet and well pleaſed; that they neither grieve, nor fear, nor ſolicitouſly deſire, nor vainly hope for uncertain things: but reſt ſatisfied in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and moſt certain joy and hope, which ariſes out of a pure Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is proved from <hi>two</hi> effects of the Fear of God, viz. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of which teaches us what to follow, and what to fly: and furniſhes us with ſuch caution, that we be not impoſed on, in the choice of that which ſeems to be good for us. The <hi>other</hi> inſtructs us to do our whole Duty, towards God, towards our Neighbour, and towards our ſelves. In which <hi>two</hi> all Religion and piety, together with ſatisfaction, tranquillity and felicity, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe effects are more known than their cauſes, and it would be uncertain what he meant by the fear of God, unleſs he explained it by thoſe things wherein it conſiſts; he begins his Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this Subject with thoſe effects; and employs himſelf wholly in ſhewing what are the Offices of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice:</hi> that he might inform us not only what is the Chief Good, to which we ought to aſpire; but by what ways and means we may come at it.</p>

                        <hi>XI.</hi> Of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> therefore, which is converſant in the choice of things; he treats in the firſt place; Chapter the <hi>Seventh:</hi> becauſe no man can act either righteouſly, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
<pb facs="tcp:46873:10"/>or temperately, unleſs, by the benefit of Prudence, he be before inſtructed what courſe is to be held in every one of theſe, and of what force they are unto our happineſs. He explains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its various Offices in ſuch Documents as theſe; <hi>That a good Fame is to be deſired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things; That Death ought to be the Subject of our frequent Meditations; That thoſe things are to be avoided, which incite to pleaſure, and the contrary to be followed, which admoniſh us to be modeſt and ſober; That ſeverity and gravity are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before mirth; Chaſtiſements and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be willingly admitted; Flattery and ſoothing people to be caſhiered; Not to be too much diſturbed at calumnies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; To take no Bribes; To expect the iſſue and concluſion of things; To bridle anger, as an Enemy to reaſon; To love the uſe of money, not mony it ſelf;</hi> and ſuch like. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which, laſt of all, he adjoins a brief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Wiſdom; rejecting both the larger Explication of its effects, and its praiſes, to the end of the <hi>ninth</hi> Chapter, and beginning of the <hi>tenth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>firſt</hi> Part concerning <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is handled in the <hi>twelve</hi> firſt Verſes of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <hi>XII.</hi> Then he enters upon the other, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Juſtice:</hi> which he divides into that which reſpects God, and that which reſpects men. The former of which (comprehended under the names
<pb facs="tcp:46873:11"/>of <hi>Religion, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi>) conſiſts in this: That in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, we conceive aright and judge well of God, and of his Providence in the Adminiſtration of humane Affairs; and <hi>then</hi> that we pay Him that Honour, Worſhip and Service, which is due unto His Divine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>This Diſcourſe, which he touches upon from the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter he reſumes again in the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues it from the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of it, to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the IX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                     <p>As for that <hi>Juſtice</hi> which reſpects others, it is manifold. For it is either towards men, or towards women: Which conſiſts, in a manner, altogether in ſhunning both the Extremes of it, and obſerving an <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, moderation or equity; and hath reſpect to their offences, either againſt our ſelves or others: which we are partly to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and partly to bear withal. Which is the ſumm of his Diſcourſe, from the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe, to the beginning of the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Where interſperſing a few things, after his manner, in the praiſe of Wiſdom, he begins ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diviſion of <hi>Juſtice:</hi> concerning the Duty of Subjects to their Princes, from the <hi>ſecond</hi> Verſe to the <hi>eighth;</hi> and on the other ſide, the Duty of Princes towards their Subjects: of both which, it may be fit to give a larger account. For this <hi>Tractate</hi> is truly Royal, and worthy to be read perpetually, in this moſt turbulent Age, both by high and low: That from hence Subjects may
<pb facs="tcp:46873:11"/>learn to perform Obedience, and the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance both in word and deed towards their Princes; chuſing rather to bear and ſuffer any thing, than to attempt Rebellion againſt them; and Kings may alſo remember, that they ought to govern their Kingdoms, according to the Rules of Law and Equity, and not according to their own will and pleaſure; God having committed unto them the Scepter of Juſtice, Clemency, and Welfare of their Subjects; not the Scepter of Cruelty, Tyranny, and Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>In which this Wiſe King obſerving both Princes and People, to be too negligent, and that thence ariſeth a very great licenſe in ſinning, leſt well affected minds ſhould be offended at this horrible corruption of manners; he digreſſeth into a long, but very profitable and neceſſary Diſputation of God<hi>'s</hi> Providence, and the Oeconomy of Juſtice. Which though the wicked deny, and deride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee not ſuch manifeſt difference, as one would expect, made between the Good, and the Bad, in the Events that befal them both; yet he adviſes all that fear the Divine Majeſty not to be dejected and diſheartned at this; nor to ſearch with too much curioſity into God<hi>'s</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; but ſtedfaſtly reſolving, that it ſhall not be well with the wicked, though all things flow at preſent according to their hearts deſire, and that whatſoever the godly may ſuffer now, they ſhall find at laſt that God is their Friend; to look upon themſelves therefore as happy men, both in the peace of their Conſcience in this World,
<pb facs="tcp:46873:12"/>and in a ſure and certain hope of a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which account, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcates this counſel, That they who are ſtudious to fear God, and do well, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of God's Adminiſtration and of the event of things, ſhould enjoy the preſent good things, which his Divine Bounty beſtows upon them; with cheerful minds, and with thankſgiving to Him. This Diſcourſe (which it muſt be confeſſed is not altogether ſo methodical as ſome other) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) from the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>eighth</hi> Chapter, to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the <hi>ninth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe he had ſhown, that the event of things is not in our own counſel and in humane Wiſdom, but in the hand of God, leſt any body ſhould be ſo weak or perverſe, as thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That it is the ſame thing, whether we act wiſely or fooliſhly; he again makes a Digreſſion into the praiſes of Wiſdom; ſhowing how much it excells folly, from the effects of both. It begins at the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe, and reaches to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>tenth</hi> Chapter. Where he returns to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, about the mutual Offices of Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one another; both of Princes and Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And then in the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt Verſes of the <hi>eleventh</hi> Chapter, he exhorts moſt earneſtly to Liberality, and Almſgiving; which is no ſmall part of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And with that he concludes the <hi>two</hi> effects of the Fear of God; <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <hi>XIII.</hi> The reſt of the Work is his <hi>Perorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> in which he fully opens his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Chief Good: which he confirms to
<pb facs="tcp:46873:12"/>lie wholly in a truly religious Fear of God. Which therefore he ſeriouſly exhorts every one to make their ſtudy as early as is poſſible: before dull and unactive Old Age, and Death it ſelf, (both which he elegantly deſcribes) come upon us, and, before we think of it, oppreſs us.</p>
                     <p>This is the method of this moſt excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: which I cannot but exhort all men to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diligently, and with great intention of mind; both for the Authors ſake, and for the matter of it. Which he handles in ſuch a manner, as firſt to draw us from the deſire and love of earthly things; and from the perverſe uſe of them: and then to lead us unto the true and lawful uſe of them, without any offence to God, as well as without hurt to our ſelves. And he teaches us how we may, without a prepoſterous ſolicitude and anxiety about events, enjoy all things in the Fear of God; with tranquility and ſatisfaction of mind at preſent; and at laſt, by the ſame Fear of God and obſervance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, arrive at a never-dying felicity.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, He interſperſes through the whole Diſcourſe abundance of Common Places, both Philoſophical and Theological; which are ſo fitted to make us every way more learned, more prudent, and more pious; that we ſhall find great uſe of them in all the paſſages of our lives.</p>

                        <hi>XIV.</hi> Thus that learned <hi>Spaniard</hi> concludes his Preface: which I have contracted, that I might ſet before the Readers eyes in one ſhort view, both the deſign and the procedure of the Diſcourſe.
<pb facs="tcp:46873:13"/>Of the former (the Deſign) there is no doubt: and the latter is very regular, as it will further appear, in the explication I ſhall give of it. Wherein I have not followed this Author through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in every Part of this Diviſion of the Book; becauſe, though for the moſt part I take it to be accurate enough; yet, I think, in ſeveral places I had reaſon to differ from him; and take another way to make the connexion more eaſie and natural; and the ſenſe thereby more clear and evident.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech God, that the pains I have taken herein may not be in vain; but prove an effectual means both to make the mind of <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Book better underſtood; and to turn all our minds from theſe frivolous things, about which now they are too much employed, unto the ſolid and full Good which here he recommends to us. Who may be the better truſted in what he ſaith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had tried what ſatisfaction could be found in all manner of enjoyments here: and it could not be objected to him that he diſparaged the World, merely becauſe he could not get any ſhare in it, or had not the liberty which was neceſſary to enjoy it. For no man ever had greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or gave a greater looſe to his deſires; but, after all the experiments he could make, came to this reſolution which he had better have taken at firſt; that Religion and Vertue are the only things can make a man happy.</p>
                     <p>And perhaps, as God ſuffered St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to doubt of our Saviour's Reſurrection, for the greater confirmation of our Faith; by the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb facs="tcp:46873:13"/>he at laſt received: ſo he let this great man go aſtray, that by his dear-bought experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he might teach us this Wiſdom; to keep the cloſer to God in faithful obedience.</p>
                     <p>Which it will be a very great ſhame, it we do not learn, who live under the inſtruction of a greater Maſter than <hi>Solomon;</hi> the Son of God himſelf. By whom we are taught theſe things in a more effectual manner; not only by his Doctrine, but by his whole life, and by his death: in which he declared the greateſt neglect and contempt of this World; and that his mind was wholly ſet upon the other.</p>
                     <p>And what a bleſſed ſort of <hi>Reformation</hi> would it be, if (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſomewhere admirably ſpeaks) we would all lay aſide our diſſenſions, ſtrifes, and quarrels, and ſtudy the Leſſons our Lord hath taught us. Whoſe buſineſs it was in this World, to form unto Himſelf <hi>a people that ſhould wholly depend on heaven, and placing no confidence in any Earthly ſupport or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſhould be after another manner rich, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner wiſe, after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner noble, after another manner potent, in one word, after another manner happy: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to attain felicity by the contempt of thoſe things, which are vulgarly admired. A people that ſhould be Strangers to filthy luſts, by ſtudying in this fleſh the life of Angels; that ſhould have no need of Divorce, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to mend or to bear all manner of Evils; that ſhould be wholly ignorant of
<pb facs="tcp:46873:14"/>Oaths, as thoſe who neither diſtruſt, nor will deceive any body; that make not the getting of Money their buſineſs, having laid up their Treaſures in Heaven; that ſhould not be tickled with vain glory, becauſe they refer all to the Glory of Chriſt alone; be void of ambition, as diſpoſed, the greater they are, to ſubmit themſelves, ſo much the more, unto all men for Chriſt his ſake; that ſhould be unacquainted with wrath, much more with revenge, as ſtudying to deſerve well of thoſe who deſerve ill of them: that ſhould be ſo innocent in their behaviour, as to force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations even from Heathens; that ſhould be born again to the purity and ſimplicity of Infants; that ſhould live like the Birds of the Air, without care and ſolicitude; among whom there ſhould be the greateſt concord, nothing different from that which is between the Members of the ſame Body; in which mutual Charity ſhould make all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; that whether there were any good thing, it ſhould help to ſupply him that wanted, or any evil thing, it ſhould either be removed or mitigated by the good Offices of others; who ſhould be ſo wiſe by the teaching of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the example of Chriſt, as to be the Salt of the Earth, the Light of the World, like a City on an Hill, conſpicuous to all the Country round about; whoſe abilities, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are, ſhould make them forward to
<pb facs="tcp:46873:14"/>help others; to whom this life ſhould ſeem vile, Death deſirable, out of a longing for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; who ſhould neither fear tyranny, nor death, nor the Devil himſelf, relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the invincible power of Chriſt alone; who ſhould act in all things ſo, as to be ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ready for that laſt, and moſt to be wiſht for Day, when they ſhall take poſſeſſion of true and of eternal felicity.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a] V. 1.</hi> The Wiſdom, Vertue and Dignity of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor making his Work more valuable and regarded, <hi>Solomon</hi> (or he who compoſed this Book from what he had heard him deliver, or found in his Writings) begins with his Quality; not merely as a King, and as the Son of a Great King, and of a great people, in a famous City: but, which was moſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as a publick Inſtructor, having ability and authority to inform all men where they ſhould find that happineſs, which they ignorantly ſought, but could not meet withal. This he proclaims with a loud voice; deſiring ſerious attention to ſuch a weighty Diſcourſe, and that they would often recollect, as he had done (all which may be the import of the word <hi>Koheleth</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">See Preface, num. IV.</note>) how frivolous and trivial, all thoſe things are, which moſt men purſue with the greateſt earneſtneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.</hi> This is the Subject of this Book; to ſhow how ſenſleſs it is to place our happineſs in theſe frail and inconſtant things, that we enjoy upon this Earth: which he not only pronounces, but proves to be mere emptineſs. So <hi>Vanity</hi> ſignifies; and what is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon that, diſſatisfaction, trouble and affliction. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> LXXVIII. <hi>33.</hi> And this, beyond what can be expreſſed: for our Tranſlators take it to be a word of the ſame import with <hi>Tohu;</hi> which is uſed in the Hebrew language, when they would ſignifie that of which they ſpeak, to be ſo trivial, that it is below leſs than nothing, XL. <hi>Iſai. 17.</hi> And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> is not content with this ſingle word, but doubles it; to denote the extreme diſſatisfaction he found in all things, which made a ſhow of affording him contentment; but performed nothing of that which they ſeemed to promiſe. So the Word <hi>Vanity</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46873:19"/>is alſo uſed for that which is falſe, lying and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, LXII. <hi>Pſal. 9.</hi> and other places, where <hi>Idols</hi> are called <hi>Vanities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.</hi> Here begins the Proof of his Aſſertion; by conſidering <hi>firſt</hi> the mind of man: which runs from one thing to another without any end: but finds no ſatisfaction remaining after all its reſtleſs thoughts. And then the body of man <hi>(V. 4.)</hi> which, as proud and lofty as it now looks, muſt moulder into Duſt; and the pooreſt perſon perhaps ſhall tread upon its Grave. For it cannot laſt like the Earth, from whence it comes; which ſtands for ever, as a publick Theatre, whereon men enter and act their Part, and then go off and never appear again: and when they go (as ſome prettily rather than ſolidly gloſs upon thoſe Words, <hi>The Earth abideth for ever</hi>) they can carry none of it along with them, but leave it all behind them, unto thoſe that come after; who paſs away alſo, leaving the Earth where they found it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 5.</hi> The Sun alſo in a ſettled courſe, obſerves its times of riſing and ſetting: whereas man, when he goes down to the Earth, cannot like the Sun come up again. So the <hi>fifth</hi> Verſe ſeems to be moſt naturally connected with the foregoing; and in like manner the <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh</hi> Verſes are to be expounded. There are many Interpreters indeed, who look upon the things mentioned in theſe three Verſes, only as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of the inſtability of all humane Affairs, and of the conſtant revolutions of the ſame miſeries: which cannot be hindred by any humane counſels, but will return after all the changes, whereby we think to mend our ſelves. Upon which ſenſe I have juſt touched in my Paraphraſe, but not followed it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not ſeem to me to be the ſcope of theſe Verſes. In which man is repreſented, by <hi>four</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, with the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Wind,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46873:20"/>the <hi>Sea,</hi> to be more ſubject to Vanity than other things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 8.</hi> Which having thus illuſtrated, he proceeds here more particularly to conſider, what he had ſaid in general words <hi>(V. 3.)</hi> of mans vain endeavour to ſatisfie himſelf in worldly deſigns and contrivances: in which he is tired, but comes to no end of his deſires. How ſhould he? when his whole buſineſs here is only to do and to enjoy the very ſame things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again: as all men have done before us, and ſhall do after us, v. <hi>9, 10, 11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 9.</hi> We may fanſie indeed, that we have found ſome new thing: but this conceit proceeds merely from our ignorance; as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> excellently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in his firſt Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi> Chap. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Learning and Knowledge, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> takes away vain and exceſſive admiration; which is the very root of all weak counſels. For we admire things, either becauſe they are <hi>new,</hi> or becauſe they are <hi>great.</hi> As for <hi>Novelty,</hi> there is no man that conſiders things thoroughly, but hath this printed in his heart, <hi>There is nothing new under the Sun:</hi> nor can any man much admire a Puppet-Play, who doth but thruſt his head behind the Curtain, and ſeeth the Inſtruments and Wires whereby they are moved. As for <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> we may ſay as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> who, after his great Conqueſts in <hi>Aſia,</hi> receiving Letters of ſome ſmall Fights or Skirmiſhes in <hi>Greece,</hi> at the taking of ſome Bridge, or Fort, was wont to tell his Friends, that <hi>it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that they had ſent him News of the Battles of</hi> Homer<hi>'s Frogs and Mice:</hi> ſo, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if a man conſider the Univerſe, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of it, to him this Globe of Earth with the men upon it, and their buſie motions (excepting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Divineneſs of Souls) will not ſeem much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46873:20"/>more conſiderable than <hi>an Hillock of Ants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome creep up and down with their Corn, others with their Eggs, others empty: all about a very little heap of Duſt.</hi>
                        </q> And as <hi>Melancthon</hi> well obſerves, the ſame deſires, the ſame counſels, the ſame ends, the ſame cauſes of War, and calamitous events, return again: according to that of <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, While humane nature continues what it is, the like miſchiefs will happen; ſometimes leſs, ſometimes more direfully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 12.</hi> Thus having confirmed his main Propoſitions, by ſuch general Arguments as reach to all things in this World; he proceeds here to a more particular proof of it, from his own proper experience. And deſigning (before he declared his own Opinion of the Chief Good, and by what means it may be attained) to confute the vain fancies of men about it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them, as I have ſhown in the Preface, to <hi>four</hi> Heads. And obſerving that ſome place it in <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and curious inquiries into all manner of things, others in <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or in <hi>both</hi> theſe together; others in <hi>honour</hi> and power; others in <hi>riches</hi> and heaps of wealth; he begins with that which is the moſt plauſible. And demonſtrates, from the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe to the end of this Chapter, how little ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be found in the mere ſpeculation of things; though a man arrive at the higheſt degree of humane knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 13, 14. Melancthon</hi> reſtrains theſe <hi>two</hi> Verſes, to political Wiſdom, in the Government of Kingdoms. Which gives men a double affliction: <hi>firſt,</hi> in that the Wiſeſt men often err in their counſels; and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that events ſometimes do not anſwer to the beſt counſels that men can follow. Examples of the <hi>firſt</hi> are innumerable: Sometime they err through ambition, as <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> after <hi>Alexander;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time through a falſe opinion of Right, as <hi>Brutus;</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46873:21"/>ſometime, through over-doing, buſie headedneſs and inquietude of mind, as <hi>Pericles;</hi> ſometime through anger, as <hi>Marius.</hi> And how many ways good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels have miſcarried, it is too long here to remember: becauſe, it is here further obſervable, that ſometime more doubtfulneſs and uncertainty of mind what courſe to take, is as great a torment to the mind as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> was firſt perplexed in his Counſels, before he ſaw the diſaſtrous event of his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. To conclude this; All Government is ſo full of cares, perplexities, and impediments, that it made <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſay, If he were to begin the World again, he would rather die than be promoted to it. And <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> that he was as glad when he was rid of his Office, as he would have been to be delivered from a mad Dog.</p>
                     <p>But this I take to be too ſtraight a ſenſe; though it be agreeable enough to what he ſaith v. <hi>12.</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office: and therefore I have inlarged it further in my <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> though <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> alſo ſeem to have a reſpect to it, when he thus interprets this place Orat. LIII. p. <hi>750. That all things here below are poſſeſſed with an uncouth and execrable ſpirit</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>ſo that a man cannot comprehend how abſurdly all humane affairs are managed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 14.</hi> The word we tranſlate <hi>vexation</hi> is found on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Book, and is capable of many ſenſes, all pertinent to the ſcope of this place. For according to the ſeveral Fountains from whence it may be derived; this Phraſe may be interpreted, either <hi>anguiſh</hi> of Spirit, or <hi>breaking</hi> of Spirit, or <hi>preying upon</hi> the Spirits; or (in another ſenſe of the word Spirit) <hi>feeding on the Wind or Air:</hi> none of which I have neglected in the Parapraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 15.</hi> The ſhortneſs of humane Wit, though never ſo much improved, is here repreſented by two things:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46873:21"/>
                        <hi>firſt,</hi> that it cannot remove what is inconvenient; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that it cannot ſupply what is deficient, in any condition of life. Or, as others will have it, the firſt part of the Verſe refers to the inability of man to rectifie that <hi>perverſeneſs</hi> (as the Hebrew word we tranſlate <hi>crooked</hi> ſignifies) which he finds in himſelf or others; and the latter part, to the ſmall reach oſ humane underſtanding, which can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but a very imperfect knowledge, either of <hi>words, things, times, perſons</hi> or <hi>actions;</hi> as ſome branch out the innumerable Particulars of which we muſt be content to be ignorant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 16.</hi> I have not curiouſly diſtinguiſhed between <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> either in this Verſe, or in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But there may be this difference per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently made, That <hi>Wiſdom</hi> directs a man, in the practical affairs of life, unto that which is moſt fit for his purpoſe, according to the various circumſtances wherein he may be. It conſiſts chiefly in a clear judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to diſcern our true intereſt, and the proper means to compaſs it: together with a preſentneſs of mind, to obviate ſudden accidents. And then <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> relates to the ſpeculation of natural things; in their cauſes and effects, their properties and differences, and ſuch like things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 17. Madneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> may refer alſo to all the idle Speculations, wherein men of Parts and Wit, ſometimes not only <hi>imploy,</hi> but <hi>applaud</hi> themſelves, as the <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe words ſeems to import in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. This trifling ſort of Knowledge is notably deſcribed by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his <hi>Praiſe of Folly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 18.</hi> If there be any difference to be made between <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> I have noted it above upon v. <hi>16.</hi> As for <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> they may be thus diſtinguiſhed, That the former, in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word, includes in it <hi>indignation</hi> which is a ſharp <hi>anger</hi> mingled with ſcorn; to find either our Perſons
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46873:22"/>and Counſels contemned, or our Projects and well laid Deſigns defeated. Such as was in <hi>Achitophel;</hi> whoſe penetrating Wit made his rage the greater, to ſee his judicious advice rejected, and the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy utterly diſappointed. The <hi>other</hi> word <hi>(ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row)</hi> properly denotes an extreme great trouble and ſickneſs of mind; and is ſometimes applied to pains in the Body: which is the effect too frequently of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard ſtudy <hi>Melancthon</hi> underſtands the whole Verſe (as he did v. <hi>13, 14.</hi>) of the trouble that wiſe men have, when they are intruſted with Government, to ſee the confuſions, errors, vices and calamities of Mankind. And their afflictions are the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not only more ſenſible than other men of preſent evils, but foreſee by the preſent thoſe that are future: and therefore are tormented with a ſore pain and grief, both for what they feel and for what they fear. For they know, that from the firſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there commonly follow greater confuſions: as when <hi>Pericles</hi> had once ſtirred up a War, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the deſtruction of almoſt all the great Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi> And it is too truly ſaid by <hi>Pindar,</hi> that <hi>it is eaſie for any body to diſturb a City; but God alone can reſtore peace unto it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be too limited a ſenſe; but it is no ſmall trouble to a wiſe and prudent perſon, as <hi>Corranus</hi> excellently expreſſes it, to behold the miſerable diſorders and confuſions of humane affairs. For how is it poſſible to avoid it, nay how can a man chuſe but be filled with indignation, to ſee Juſtice, Equity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, Fidelity, Integrity and Conſtancy, and all other ſuch like Vertues ſlighted and diſregarded by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and on the contrary, Injuſtice, Baſeneſs, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, Flattery, and ſuch like Vices, poſſeſs the World, and carry all before them? Or what man can, without vexation, obſerve the prepoſterous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind, which magnifies thoſe things, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46873:22"/>are not only vain but hurtful and pernicious; and not only contemn but hate thoſe things, which are truly good for them; nay, alone deſirable: No man can either be wiſe alone to himſelf, in ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Fools and mad men, without the greateſt grief and indignation: nor can be accommodate himſelf, with an equal mind, to the dotages of the common people; when he ſees that which is better.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Obſervation, concerning this anxiety of ſpirit which ariſeth out of Knowledge; in the beginning of his Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaith he, doth not paſs this cenſure abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon Wiſdom and Knowledge, but only ſets forth the true Bounds, wherein humane knowledge is to be circumſcribed: which if we do not obſerve, it will prove very troubleſome to us and others. And thoſe limitations are <hi>three. Firſt,</hi> That we do not ſo place our felicity in Knowledge, as to forget our mortality. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we uſe not our Knowledge to beget anxiety, but repoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind: and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we do not preſume by the contemplation of Nature, to think our ſelves able to comprehend the Myſteries of God. The firſt and the laſt of theſe are plain enough; and therefore I ſhall only note what he ſaith of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:</hi> that it is certain, no anxiety or perturbation of mind ariſeth from Knowledge, but by mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. For all Knowledge, and Admiration (which is the Seed of Knowledge) is pleaſant in it ſelf: but when we fall to frame Concluſions from thence, which, obliquely applied to our own affairs, beget either <hi>weak fears,</hi> or <hi>immoderate deſires,</hi> then ariſeth that torment and trouble of mind, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaketh. For then Knowledge is no longer <hi>dry light,</hi> (which <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> was wont to ſay was the beſt) but <hi>moiſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46873:23"/>light,</hi> ſteeped and infuſed in the humours of the affections.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for that Expoſition which ſome have given of theſe words, that <hi>he increaſeth the number of his ſtripes (or wounds) who increaſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> but makes no uſe of it, nor takes care that his obedience riſe in ſome good proportion with it; it is not the proper ſenſe of the place, but rather an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the words to another profitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                     <p>But the greateſt difficulty in this Verſe, and indeed in this Chapter, is to tell what is meant by <hi>Siddah</hi> and <hi>Siddoth;</hi> which he calls in the Concluſion of this Deſcription of his Magnificence, <hi>the delights</hi> or delicious pleaſures, <hi>of the Sons of men.</hi> Theſe <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath probably conjectured to be moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Compoſition in Muſick, or moſt elegant Verſes, ſet by a rare Artiſt among the Phaenicians, called <hi>Sido,</hi> to the moſt raviſhing and melting Notes.

For there were no Wars in his time, till the latter end of his reign;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46873:29"/>and then he was rather worſted, than victorious.

But this ſeems to be far fetcht; and therefore I have let it, and divers other Interpretations, alone: and only expreſſed the ſenſe of our own Tranſlation, which takes theſe for <hi>Muſical Inſtruments;</hi> and thoſe of ſuch extraordinary ſweetneſs, that they left no part of a mans ſoul untoucht, nor room for any other pleaſure (ſo ſome derive it, from a word ſignifying <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>) and had ſome regard to the LXX, who underſtand it of ſuch as waited upon him at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (<hi>Cup-bearers,</hi> and ſuch like Officers) where Muſick alſo was ſeldom wanting, but made a part of the entertainment of great perſons; as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it in the Paraphraſe.</p>

                        <hi>[i] V. 9. my wiſdom remained]</hi> For it was not the manner of Great Men, in ancient time, to paſs their Feaſts only in eating and drinking, and, after the ſottiſh Cuſtom now, to ſend the Cups going round, when all was taken away: but to ſpend the time in pleaſant, but learned, Diſcourſes, or in telling Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or propounding and reſolving Queſtions; which might whet the Wit, and form mens manners, or open the Secrets of Nature; and at the ſame time both refreſh and inſtruct the mind. As we ſee at <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Marriage-Feaſt, he propounded a Riddle to be unfolded, concerning the Generation of Bees, out the Carkaſe of a Lyon. In <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Sympoſiacks,</hi> there are abundance of ſuch merry, and learned Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſolved. And <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in his <hi>Diepnoſophiſts,</hi> hath exerpt the Flower of all Arts, and Authors, Poets, Philoſophers, and Hiſtorians; in <hi>Virgil</hi> alſo at the end of his Firſt Book of <hi>Aeneids, Jopas</hi> is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46873:30"/>introduced ſinging a Philoſophical Song (at the Feaſt which <hi>Dido</hi> made) concerning the Motions of the Moon and the Sun, and in ſhort, of all that <hi>Atlas,</hi> that moſt famous Aſtronomer, had taught. And in another place, <hi>Aeneas</hi> himſelf relates the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi>

                        <hi>[k] V. 10. my portion]</hi> Though Wiſdom thus bridled his pleaſures, yet it did not reſtrain him from ſuch a free and plentiful enjoyment of them, that there was no ſort which he did not taſte as highly of, as was poſſibly; without making himſelf a mere Fool. This he calls <hi>his portion,</hi> by a Metaphor taken from Inheritances; which being divided into parts, every one of the Children had his part given him; or from <hi>Lots,</hi> which as they were uſed among Merchants, ſo ſometimes in the dividing of Inheritances: when the Heirs could not agree among themſelves, about the aequality of the <hi>portions</hi> which were ſet out for them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And yet, for all that, after he had taken the benefits of Wiſdom into a ſecond conſideration, v. <hi>13, 14;</hi> he could not but conclude again, that there is a <hi>Vanity</hi> in that alſo. Which is <hi>threefold;</hi> as there are three ends for which men ſtudy Wiſdom. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they may provide for their ſafety and ſecurity: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they may commend their Names to Poſterity; or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they may leave to their Children, what their ſingular Prudence, and great diligence hath gathered together. But all theſe he ſhows are vain Deſigns.</p>

Which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (in his IV. Book of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning,</hi> chap. <hi>2.</hi>) extends to ſuch Conſiderations as this; that <q>in all times, Witches and old Women, and impoſtors, have been Rivals and Competitors, in the reputation and opinion of the multitude, with the ableſt Phyſicians; and contended with them for the fame of Cures. Nay, the impoſtor bears away the prize, and Vertue lies under the cenſure. Such is the weakneſs and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men, they prefer a Mountebank, or a Witch, before a learned Phyſician: which the Poets obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they made <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Circe,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter; both Children of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And what follows from hence, but that Phyſicians ſay to themſelves, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in another caſe, <hi>It befalls to me, as it doth to the Fool; why ſhould I labour to be more wiſe?</hi>

                        <p>Upon the mention of God's over-ruling Providence, in the latter end of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Solomon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from thence to illuſtrate (in the <hi>firſt</hi> part of this Chapter) both thoſe things, of which he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed before, <hi>viz. firſt,</hi> the <hi>imperfection</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wiſdom; which is confined to a certain time or ſeaſon, for all things that it would effect: which if we neglect, or let ſlip, all our contrivances ſignifie nothing. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That the utmoſt <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> at which our Wiſdom can arrive in this World, conſiſts in theſe things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In being contented with this order wherein God hath placed all things,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46873:31"/>and not diſquieting our ſelves about that which it is not in our power to remedy, or alter; at leaſt, not for the preſent. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In obſerving and taking the fitteſt opportunity of doing every thing; as the moſt certain means to tranquility: there being nothing that makes our mind more unquiet, than ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream) as we ſpeak) and when the wind is againſt us, labouring to bring about our ends, and to obtain our deſires: and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In taking the comfort of what we have at preſent; and making a ſeaſonable and legitimate uſe of it: And <hi>laſtly,</hi> In bearing the viciſſitudes that we find in all humane things, with an equal mind; becauſe they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and unalterable.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the things he had ſuggeſted in the Concluſion of the former Chapter; and the beginning of this may have relation to every one of them. And ſince he had ſpoken before alſo (v. <hi>9, 10,</hi> of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) concerning the moderating of pleaſures by Wiſdom and of the ſtudy of Wiſdom by ſeaſonable pleaſures; I do not know but he may have reſpect unto that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: and therefore I have begun with it, in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>

                           <hi>Caſtalio</hi> goes ſtill further, and thinks the meaning of the firſt part of this Chapter may be, that it is in vain to expect our happineſs in this World: for this is no more the time, and the place for it, than Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is the Harveſt. But we muſt ſtay till the next life for it: which is the proper time for complete happineſs: here we muſt be content with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears.

Which bolds good even in Vertue it ſelf: which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but in its place. For Fortitude hath not always been ſucceſsful, (as the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> obſerves) nor Temperance ſafe; nor Juſtice opportune: the fury and inſolence of the outragious people, having in ſome inſurrections grown to that exceſs; that is hath been greater Wiſdom to paſs by a while, than to puniſh them. And it is very apparent alſo in our Councels, when they are conducted merely by humane Wiſdom; which is not able, without a Divine direction, to chuſe the moſt fortunate (as we call them) and happy Seaſons for undertakings. <hi>Brutus, Cicero, Hertius Panſa,</hi> all thought to reſtore the ancient eſtate of the Roman Commonwealth (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> notes) but were deceived; and after the ſame manner many are ſtill, and will always be deceived. Then buſineſſes proceed, when we obey his Divine directions, and He aſſists: and yet then ſometimes more, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs difficultly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 3. kill]</hi> In the third Verſe I have taken the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of following my own Judgment in expounding the first part of it: which I have not referred to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſparing Offenders, as Interpreters do; but to the condition of Diſeaſes that are in our own Bodies. For, though the other be an excellent ſenſe, yet, this ſeems to be more agreeable to the Wiſe mans meaning. Becauſe he is hitherto ſpeaking of things Natural; and the word <hi>heal</hi> alſo directs rather to that ſenſe, which I have given of <hi>killing,</hi> than the common one. The ſame may be ſaid of the next part of the Verſe; there being a crazineſs in Buildings, as well as in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46873:36"/>the Body of man: and ſome Weather ſo improper to raiſe a Fabrick, that the parts will not hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that which cements them moulders ſo faſt away, that that time were better ſpent, in pulling down an houſe, than in building it up.</p>
                     <p>As for the reſt of the <hi>Calender</hi> or <hi>Ephemeris</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls it) which the Wiſe man hath made of the diverſities of times and occaſions for all actions; I need give no further account of it here, than I have done in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 9. What profit]</hi> Nor is it hard to expound the inference he makes in this Verſe, from the foregoing induction: which I have expreſſed as fully as I could in the Paraphraſe; and more largely in the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this Chapter. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> thinks, he only intends to reflect upon the great inconſtancy, as of all earthly things, ſo of humane actions (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for inſtance, men are madly in love with a Woman, and in time they as much hate her; now they are eager to get, and at another time they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely ſpend, ſometimes they kill, and ſometimes are killed, ſometimes do nothing but talk, and at another time have not a word to ſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and therefore all his labours are vain. But I have extended it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a reſpect to other things, which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named induction ſuggeſts to us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 11. world in their heart]</hi> There is greater difficulty in this Verſe, if we connect it with the reſt of the Diſcourſe; as we ought to do. Which I have endeavoured to explain by taking the word <hi>Haolam, the World;</hi> for the preſent ſtate of things, in this Age wherein we live (which is a genuine ſenſe of it) whereof God hath given us ſome underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but not ſo perfect as to be able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of the reaſon and ſcope of every thing, that we ſee happen in this World; becauſe we are ignorant of what went before, and of what will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46873:37"/>follow after, when we had or ſhall have no Being here.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly underſtood of the works of Nature. And in this ſenſe the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (in the beginning of his Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) hath admirably expounded it; in this manner: In theſe words, <hi>He hath placed the world in mans heart,</hi> &amp;c. <q>
                           <hi>Solomon</hi> declares not obſcurely, that God hath framed the mind of man, as a Mirrour, or Looking-glaſs, capable of the Image of the whole World; and as deſirous to receive it, as the eye is to entertain the light: and not only delighted in beholding the variety of things, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude of times; but ambitious to find out and diſcover the immoveable and inviolable Laws and Decrees of Nature. And though he intimate, that this whole Oeconomy of Nature (which he calls, <hi>The work, that God hath wrought, from the beginning to the end</hi>) cannot be found out by man; it doth not derogate from the capacity of his mind, but is to be imputed to the impediments of Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is one Interpreter <hi>(Corranus)</hi> who by <hi>Olam, World,</hi> underſtands the Circular motion of things for the ſervice of man. But I can find no ſuch uſe of the word any where; elſe, the ſenſe would be elegant enough, which ariſes from thence; <hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>revolution</hi> being remote from our knowledge, and a ſecret to us; who cannot tell, what day or hour it will be: we ought not to trouble our ſelves about this; but make uſe of the preſent, and refer the reſt to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancthon</hi> alſo hath an unuſual Interpretation; which is, that God made things ſo, that we ſhould ſweetly enjoy them (that he underſtands by <hi>placing the World in mans heart</hi>) but men make the uſe of them unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, by their wandring deſires, by their vain ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46873:37"/>by their diffidence; which makes them long after new things, and meddle with that which is unneceſſary. Like <hi>M. Anthony,</hi> who when he had gotten the moſt flouriſhing part of the Empire, could not be content; but, out of an unquiet Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the whole, and ſo loſt all. This he makes the ſenſe of the latter end of the Verſe; which he thus tranſlates, <hi>Man cannot find out the Work of God, neither the beginning nor the end of it</hi> Therefore, as I ſaid juſt now, it is Wiſdom to ſatisfie our ſelves with what we have; for the preſent only is that, which is in our own power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 12, 13.]</hi> And ſo it follows in theſe two Verſes; the ſenſe of which <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> (Orat. LIII.) hath thus briefly expreſſed, <hi>The greateſt Good of man, I perſwade my ſelf to be,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 14, 15.]</hi> And with this we muſt reſt contented, for with all our toilſome thoughts, we cannot alter the courſe of things: which God, he here ſhows, hath immutably ſetled; on purpoſe that we ſhould be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a power above our ſelves. Which it is our Wiſdom to ſtand in ſuch awe of, as not to contend with it, but ſubmit unto it: that ſo we may obtain all the favour from Him, which in ſuch a ſtate of things, as his Wiſdom hath appointed, can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to us. And here, I think, <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath very pertinently obſerved, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not merely recite, the vain complaints and endeavours of Mankind, after the manner of Philoſophers and Poets: but lays down a Rule of life, as the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that can be found, for our Diſeaſe. Which, is <hi>not to truſt to our ſelves, nor to indulge our own curioſity and appetites; but to be ſenſible of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46873:38"/>our own infirmities, to fear God, to obey his commands, to keep within the Bounds of our vocations, to beg and expect the help of God, and to acquieſce in his holy will and pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 16.]</hi> Unto theſe things it is better for us to apply our ſelves, than it is to endeavour to be great and mighty (which is another vain deſire of man, fanſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he can thereby keep off many evils) for few can be at the top of all; and ſo there muſt be ſtill greater than we, by whom we may be oppreſſed: And our vexation will be ſo much the greater, when with all our power we cannot hinder it. As for thoſe that are in the very higheſt places (if they have not that fear of God before-ſpoken of, v. <hi>14.</hi>) their power doth but betray them, to do the more miſchief unto themſelves and others; and thereby encreaſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Mankind. This ſeems to be the dependance between the foregoing Verſes and this. Wherein the Wiſe man paſſes to the conſideration of the <hi>Third</hi> thing (mentioned upon Chap. I <hi>12.</hi>) unto which ſome aſpire, as the higheſt happineſs, <hi>viz. Greatneſs, Power,</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> Which if a man be bad, make him ſo much the worſe himſelf, and the World by his means: and if he be good, will trouble him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, to find there are many abuſes, which by all his power he cannot remedy. For <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf ſaw ſeveral groſs impieties committed (as he tells us in this Verſe) even by them who were appointed to be the Guardians of mens lives, liberties and enjoyments; which he, as great a King as he was, wanted ability wholly to redreſs: but ſtill they went on ſo confidently in their wicked courſe of perverting Judgment, that he was fain to leave them to be judged by the ſupreme Judge of all, God Almighty. And if it were ſo, in the Reign of a good and wiſe King; what could be hoped for, in the Reign of thoſe who were impious and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46873:38"/>injudicious; as moſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> were? For ſuch pervert all things, by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, ambition or folly; ſo that their Subjects can have no Juſtice, nor enjoy any tranquility. And beſides, they permit (as he ſhows afterwards, Chap. V.) many corruptions to creep into the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and ridiculous rather than religious Ceremonies to be introduced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon always follows a great decay of all moral Vertue.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort; this is a great part of the Vanity and miſery, to which we are here ſubject; that, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> well notes, there are many things done unjuſtly, even under juſt Governours; becauſe they are not able to look unto all things themſelves, but muſt manage them by other men: many of which are negligent, others wicked, and ſwayed by depraved affections; and yet crafty enough to cover their own guilt. Here is the only comfort, That <hi>God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding preſerves Government, and Political Order;</hi> ☜ and in his time will judge, even the Kings and Judges of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 17.]</hi> The laſt words of this Verſe, may, in my judgment, be thus moſt literally tranſlated out of the Hebrew: <hi>There is a time for</hi> (judging) <hi>every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and every work there,</hi> viz. in thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Courts of Judgment: every thing that hath been tranſacted, in the Judicatures he had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 18.]</hi> Theſe words, which follow the former, are variouſly interpreted: but they have a perſpicuous ſenſe, if they be taken in coherence with the foregoing (as in reaſon they ought to be) without fanſying, as ſome have done, that they are ſpoken in the perſon of an <hi>Epicure.</hi> And ſo I have conſidered them; as intended to take down the vain opinion thoſe Great Men have of themſelves (which makes them tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their Inferiours) by repreſenting to them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46873:39"/>(or rather, deſiring God would effectually repreſent to their minds) how little they differ from Beaſts: ſave only in that, which they do not at all value, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <hi>viz.</hi> their immortal ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Lebaram,</hi> to <hi>manifeſt them,</hi> is commonly expounded of Gods manifeſting them unto others; but I have taken it for his ſhowing them to themſelves; agreeable to the word that follows, <hi>Lireoth, that they might ſee,</hi> &amp;c. The whole may be thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated —<hi>that God would clear their minds, that they may ſee,</hi> &amp;c. For it comes from a Root which ſignifies ſuch an accurate ſeparation of one thing from another; that the difference may be perſpicuouſly diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 21.]</hi> And thus it ſeems alſo moſt reaſonable to me, to expound this laſt Verſe, in connexion with all the reſt; and to underſtand the firſt word of it, <hi>Who;</hi> concerning thoſe perſons mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Diſcourſe. <hi>Who among thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Judges,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

For, reflecting again upon it, I obſerved the innumerable ways that were practiſed in this World, for the undoing of others; both by violence and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by fraud and calumnies (as well as by unjuſt Decrees) whereby ſo many were cruſhed, that nothing was to be ſeen or heard but the tears and cries, the ſighs and groans of ſuch as lay in a deſolate condition, and could find no relief; no, not ſo much as of one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them: For ſuch was the greatneſs of their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who had gotten all power into their hands; that as they could not defend themſelves againſt them, ſo no body elſe durſt expreſs their compaſſion towards them, much leſs plead for them; for fear of being ſerved in the ſame kind themſelves. <hi>See</hi> Annot. <hi>[a].</hi>

For ſome (ſeeing the forenamed <hi>oppreſſions;</hi> or the <hi>envy</hi> that attends upon mens induſtry and good ſucceſſes) grow idle and leave off all buſineſs (expreſſed here by <hi>folding the hands,</hi> ſee VI. <hi>Prov. 10.</hi>) becauſe it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to get, what another may preſently take away; or if he keep, it raiſes him other Enemies, who grudge to ſee him ſo happy.</p>
                     <p>By this means ſuch a man brings himſelf to extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: ſo that Phraſe, <hi>Eateth his own fleſh,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. One that is ready to die with hunger: and whoſe Wife and Children (called in Scripture a mans <hi>fleſh</hi>) are in danger to ſtarve with him. There are other Explications of this Phraſe, upon which I have touched in the Paraphraſe, which admirably expreſs the folly of him, that undoes himſelf, to avoid being undone by others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 6. better is an handful]</hi> Which though it be a very abſurd reſolution; yet he wants not Apologies for it. Nay, as if he were the only Wiſe man (<hi>ſapientum octavus,</hi> wiſer than ſeven men that can render a reaſon, as Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſpeaks) he utters Sentences (but it is <hi>like a Parable in the mouth of a Fool,</hi> a Speech full of reaſon in it ſelf, but witleſly applied) and ſays that <hi>better is an handful with quietneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein he makes a ſhow, of being the moſt contented Soul that lives; but is far from it: deſiring and coveting as much, as the moſt toiling and moiling Wretch in the World; if he might but have it, and never ſweat for it.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſome underſtand this <hi>ſixth</hi> Verſe: which others take to be <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice to the envious ſpoken of before, or to the covetous, ſpoken of afterward, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46873:43"/>they would be contented with their condition: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate riches having fewer cares; which a great Eſtate brings along with it, in abundance. Unto all which I have had reſpect in the Paraphraſe upon this Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 8. one alone]</hi> And as this is the fault on one ſide; ſo, on the other, there are thoſe who turn their thoughts altogether, to ſave what they can: pinching themſelves, by a penurious way of living; both that they may ſeem poor and not worth the ſqueezing; and likewiſe, that they may have a ſecret reſerve of unknown Treaſure, in caſe they be oppreſſed. This he deſcribes here, by the example of a man, who hath neither Wife, nor Child, nor Friend, nor Companion; but lives ſolitarily in a houſe by himſelf; where he ſpends little, and yet thinks of nothing but getting riches: which he enjoys not at all, but only looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and wiſhes ſtill to ſee more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One, not a ſecond]</hi> is properly a man without an Heir, or a Succeſſor; as <hi>v. 15.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46873:44"/>of theſe three things, to ſeek for them in other Books. For my buſineſs is only, to give a brief account of the literal ſenſe; which is this in ſhort: That a Companion will afford us his help and aſſiſtance many ways; and, if there were no other benefit to be reaped from him, this would be an exceeding great comfort; to have one, in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, into whoſe boſome we may exonerate our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; which will be the lighter, if we ſee there is any Body that ſympathizes with us in our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>

Both from their own folly, v. <hi>13, 14.</hi> (where that expreſſion is very remarkable, he <hi>is made,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> poor in his Kingdom, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> well expounds it upon <hi>I. Matth. not. a</hi>) and from the fickleneſs and inconſtancy of the peoples affections; which creates a great many troubles even to good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, v. <hi>15, 16.</hi> Where there are many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Hebrew texts; but not ſuch as makes the ſenſe obſcure: and an account is given of them by many Authors, and therefore I ſhall only note what the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath obſerved, for the illuſtration of the <hi>15th.</hi> Verſe, and what <hi>de Dieu</hi> hath noted upon the <hi>16th.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 15.]</hi> This Verſe ſets out the vanity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who are wont to preſs and flock about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Succeſſors of Princes; <q>the root of which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſaith the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (L. VII. Advanc. of Learn. Ch. <hi>2.</hi> Parab. <hi>20.</hi>) is that frenzy in the minds of men, which inclines them, with too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme an affection, unto their own projected hopes. <hi>For the man is rarely found, that is not more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46873:44"/>delighted with the contemplation of his future hopes, than with the fruition of what he poſſeſſeth.</hi> Another thing is, that <hi>novelty which is pleaſing to man's nature, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coveted:</hi> now in the Succeſſor to a Prince (called here his <hi>ſecond,</hi> he that is next to him) theſe two concur; <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Novelty.</hi> Which make <hi>more men</hi> (as <hi>Pompey</hi> ſaid to <hi>Scylla,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterward touching <hi>Macro</hi>) <hi>adore the riſing, than the ſetting Sun.</hi> And though Princes perhaps, who are in preſent poſſeſſion, be not much moved with this fond humour, nor make any great matter of it (as neither <hi>Scylla</hi> nor <hi>Tiberius</hi> did) nay they ſmile, it is poſſible, at the levity of men; and do not ſtand to fight with Dreams (for Hope is but the Dream of a man awake) yet it cannot but inwardly vex them, to ſee themſelves ſlighted, even by thoſe on whom they have beſtowed many benefits, merely in hope of receiving more from their next ſuppoſed Succeſſor. For they cannot reaſonably expect more, perhaps, from him that now reigns; and therefore they make timely applications to the next Heir. He hath done enough for them; and therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to him, who hath yet done nothing. And beſides, old men grow tenacious, moroſe and ſowre; whereas Youth is commonly liberal, jocound, without care, and ambitious to do great things; eſpecially at his entrance upon the Kingdom.</q> This, ſaith another learned Writer, makes the long life of Princes, and their power, troubleſome and grievous, both to Courtiers and people: of which they that live at <hi>Rome,</hi> do not want ocular demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing more needful for the explication of this Verſe, but only to obſerve, that the <hi>Child</hi> or <hi>Youth,</hi> who is here called <hi>the ſecond,</hi> doth not ſuppoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child or Youth that is <hi>firſt:</hi> but only ſignifie,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46873:45"/>that this Youth is <hi>ſecond in the Kingdom.</hi> Not ſecond, in reſpect to another Son, but ſecond, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Father; who reigns before him; and when he dies this Son ſucceeds him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 16.]</hi> The firſt words of this laſt Verſe, <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> ſeems to me, to have expreſſed better than any other Interpreter: they running thus, word for word, in the Hebrew; <hi>There is no end to any people.</hi> That is, no end of their fickleneſs, no bounds to their inconſtancy; but one Nation is as ſubject to it, as another. And as this Age follows the former, ſo the next will follow this; in its levity and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability. And therefore thoſe young Princes, who are tranſported with the acclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, do but feed upon Wind (as ſome, I obſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Chapter, tranſlate thoſe words, which we render <hi>vexation of Spirit</hi>): For their applauſes are like to their affections, as changeable as the Wind; which will turn another way, to ſome other perſon, when this preſent Prince grows old, or he rules ill, or the peoples fancy and humour alters. And then it will indeed be a ſore affliction to him, to ſee himſelf deſpiſed, by thoſe who formerly cried him up as if he had been their Darling.</p>
                     <p>It may be referred alſo, to the very Government it ſelf; with which the Iſraelites were not pleaſed. For when they were under Judges they deſired a King: and then they were not pleaſed with the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but wiſhed for the old <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> again: Though that in truth was the moſt exeellent <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which they would not underſtand, under the immediate Government of God Himſelf.</p>

                        <p>Under an ill Government in the State, Religion it ſelf is commonly corrupted in the Church. And therefore having ſet forth the miſeries people endure, under the oppreſſions of an abuſed Power, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of folly into which it drives them; he begins this Chapter with a Correction of thoſe errours that are in Religion. Which is the only remedy indeed, the only comfort we have againſt all the troubles to which we are ſubject in this World: but ſuch is the <hi>Vanity</hi> of Mankind, they ſpoil their very remedy, and take away all the Vertue of that, which ſhould be their ſupport; turning it into mere Ceremony, whilſt their minds remain impure, and without any true ſenſe of God. For they do not conſider that He, who is a pure mind Himſelf, muſt be better pleaſed with pure thoughts and affections, compoſed to the obſervance of his Will, and acquieſcence in his pleaſure; than with all the Sacrifices and Offerings in the World, which the wicked may bring Him as well as the good.</p>
                        <p>To prevent therefore this new folly, into which men are apt to run, when they intend to cure all the reſt, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhows all thoſe who would attain true tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind; what they muſt do, and what they muſt avoid, in the Worſhip of God. And about the middle of the Chapter, as I ſhall obſerve in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, proceeds to conſider the laſt of thoſe <hi>four</hi> things, wherein men place their happineſs.</p>

AND now, leſt any man add to the affliction and torment of his Spirit, even by that which is the only cure for it, let every one, who would be a true Worſhipper of God in whom alone lies the happineſs we ſeek) take care to avoid that negligence, which is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in many people; and to opproach with all reverence, both of Body and Soul, into his Bleſſed Preſence; but do not think to pleaſe Him with mere poſtures of Devotion; no, nor with Sacrifices and Incenſe, without the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an obedient heart, diſpoſed to do what He would have thee: For the worſt men in the World may be able to offer Him the richeſt Sacrifices: but are very impious, as well as fooliſh, if they think He delights in the fat and the Blood of Beaſts (ſave only as teſtimonies of love to Him, and acts of obedience unto his Will) for in that very thought they offend Him and make no conſcience what evil they do, while they believe their Sacrifices atone for all. <hi>See</hi> Annot. <hi>[a].</hi>

And, next to this, when thou mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Prayers to God, or giveſt Him thanks for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, deliberate with thy ſelf beforehand, what it is fit for thee to ask of Him, or to vow unto him; and let not any ſudden paſſion, make thee inconſiderately, either with thy mouth or in thy mind, deſire what is nor fit for thee to have; or promiſe what is not fit for Him to receive, or thou art not able or willing to give. But remember, firſt, how infinitely great the Lord and Governour of the World is, who comprehends all things; and then, how little and vile thou art, who proſtrateſt thy ſelf before Him: and therefore do not dare to ſpeak to Him, as an Equal, whatſoever comes into thy mind, much leſs to make Him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46873:46"/>large promiſes, which thou canſt not perform; but let a ſenſe of his Majeſty, and of thy meanneſs, overcome thee into a profound Reverence of Him; expreſſing it ſelf rather in ardent ſighs and groans, than in abundance of words; which ſignifie nothing, but want of a ſerious apprehenſion of Him. <hi>See</hi> Annot. <hi>[b].</hi>

                        <hi>[a] V. 1.]</hi> To prevent, or cure that folly mentioned in the <hi>Argument</hi> of the Chapter) he adviſes <hi>three</hi> things about the Worſhip of God. The <hi>firſt</hi> of them is in this Verſe; to look to the diſpoſition of their mind, when they go to Gods Houſe. And this pious diſpoſition of mind, conſiſts alſo in <hi>three</hi> things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in frequenting the Houſe of God, the place where He is worſhipped: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a reverent behaviour there; ſuitable to the great thoughts we have of God, and to the humble ſenſe we have of our own meanneſs: expreſſed, by <hi>keeping or obſerving the feet,</hi> i. e. taking care to put off their Shooes, or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, as the manner was in thoſe Countries; and to go barefoot into the holy places; anſwerable to which now is, <hi>uncovering the head</hi> in our Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> well diſcourſes, in more places than one, Book II. p. <hi>441, 546.</hi> and then, <hi>laſtly,</hi> in a readineſs of the Will to obey all the Divine Precepts as the beſt of Sacrifices. For this is the Sacrifice of wiſe and good men; and all other Sacrifices without this, are but the Sacrifices of Fools and wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who are able, many times, to furniſh the Altar
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46873:50"/>with more Burnt-offerings, than the beſt of men. But they are ſuch Fools as not to conſider, that this very thing encreaſes their guilt; that they imagine God will be pleaſed with the Sacrifice of Beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the Sacrifice of themſelves; in intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Will. So our Tranſlation ſeems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the laſt Clauſe of this Verſe: which may be thus alſo tranſlated, <hi>For they make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do evil.</hi> It is no part of their Religion to abſtain from wickedneſs: but fanſying by their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices they ſhall atone for that, they do not fear to commit it. To this purpoſe <hi>Maldonate</hi> expounds it, more plainly than any that I have read.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> Here he gives the <hi>ſecond</hi> Advice; which is about Prayer, and about Vows to God, or (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſeems to take it, and to which <hi>Melancthon</hi> wholly confines it) about the Doctrines we deliver concerning God: which ſhould be very well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we affirm any thing of Him. The two first are moſt proper to the place, eſpecially the latter of them: both which I have comprehended in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe of this Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> The reaſon for the foregoing Precept <hi>(of not uſing many words)</hi> taken from the conſideration of God's Greatneſs and our meanneſs (v. <hi>2.</hi>) together with the inforcement of it in this Verſe, is thus explained by St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> He requires us, that whether we ſpeak or think of God, we ſhould not venture beyond our ability; but remember our imbecillity; and that, as far as the Heaven is diſtant from the Earth, ſo much do our thoughts fall ſhort of the excellence of his Nature. And therefore our words ought to be very moderate: for as a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is full of thoughts, commonly dreams of thoſe things, whereof his head is full: ſo he that attempts to diſcourſe much of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, falls into folly. Or rather thus, Our words ought therefore to be few; becauſe even thoſe things,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46873:51"/>which we think we know, we ſee through a Glaſs, and <hi>in aenigmate;</hi> and we do but dream of that, which we fanſie we comprehend. So that when we have ſaid a great deal (and to the purpoſe, as it ſeems to us) the Concluſion of our Diſputation is mere folly.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much, we may be certain, he ſuggeſts unto us, that in a multitude of words ſpoken unto God (as I rather underſtand it) there muſt needs be many of them, as idle as mens thoughts are in a Dream. For the <hi>third</hi> Verſe ſounds thus in the Hebrew, <hi>For a Dream proceeds from</hi> (or <hi>by</hi>) <hi>a multitude of toilſome buſineſs; and the voice of a Fool from</hi> (or <hi>by</hi>) <hi>the multitude of words.</hi> That is, if a man have a multitude of cares in his mind, all the day, they will produce ſtrange, extravagant, or diſtracted Dreams in the Night: and, in like manner, if a man utter abundance of words, without conſideration and due weighing what he ſaith to God, many of them muſt needs be fooliſh; whether they be Vows, or whether they be Prayers unto him (or whether they be Diſcourſes concerning Him; for we may refer it, if we pleaſe, to all.) And the ſenſe will not much differ, if that Prepoſition, which we tranſlate <hi>from,</hi> be tranſlated <hi>with;</hi> in this manner, <hi>As Dreams come with a multitude of buſineſs</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> bring before the mind, in a confuſed manner, what we have been doing, or thinking of, all day) <hi>ſo a Fools voice comes with a multitude of words,</hi> i. e. he utters a great deal of incoherent, confuſed ſtuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus, the voice of a Fool comes <hi>in</hi> a multitude of words. And then the ſenſe will run thus: As a multitude of buſineſs tires a man, and makes him but dream at laſt about it (and therefore he had better leave off, before he be unfit to attend it) ſo when a man enlarges himſelf too far in his Prayers or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of God) he doth but babble in a Concluſion; and therefore had better be ſhorter.</p>

                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And now follows the <hi>third</hi> Advice, about the <hi>performing</hi> of Vows that have been <hi>made.</hi> Which is double; <hi>firſt,</hi> not to delay the performance, nor put it off from time to time (which is the Subject of this Verſe) leſt we be tempted, at laſt, not to perform our Vow at all; which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing: of which he ſpeaks in the next words, ver. <hi>5.</hi> and <hi>6.</hi> where he cautions againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, which men are apt to make for not being as good as their intentions. <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both excellently, in a few words (alluding to the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which ſignifies to <hi>complete</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

For a Vow is an imperfect ſort of thing till it be made good: it hath only the beginning of a good thing, and wants its finiſhing; which if it have not, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ugly and odious. For God loves not (that is, hates) to be ſo dealt withall, as if He did either not underſtand, or not mind what we ſay to Him: or would put up that affront which the pooreſt man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reſent. Who looks upon himſelf, as, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed but, deſpiſed; when men give him fair words, which either have no meaning, or deceive him when he depends upon them. This <hi>Solomon</hi> repreſents in the <hi>5th.</hi> Verſe, as far worſe, than promiſing nothing at all; in which men may be unkind, but in this they are unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 6.]</hi> And he preſſeth it further in this Verſe; where by <hi>Malach Angel,</hi> there are thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that particular Angel, which is ſuppoſed by ſome (but cannot be certainly proved) to attend upon every particular perſon; others underſtand the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who is God's <hi>Miniſter:</hi> but I have followed Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (Book II. p. <hi>438.</hi>) who takes <hi>Angel</hi> here <hi>collectively,</hi> for more than one (as <hi>Tree</hi> is put for <hi>Trees, Leaf</hi> for <hi>Leaves, III. Gen. 2, 7.</hi>) which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46873:52"/>attended upon the Divine Majeſty in his houſe, where the Vow, he is here ſpeaking of, was made (ver. <hi>1.</hi>) Which Angelical Miniſtry in God's houſe was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Jews, by filling all the Curtains of the Tabernacle with the Pictures of <hi>Cherubims, XXVI. Exod. 36, 37;</hi> and by carving the inſide of the Walls of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, with the ſame, <hi>1. King. VI;</hi> and by the Ark of the Teſtimony, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with two mighty Cherubims (having their Wings lifted up, and their Faces looking down towards it, and toward the Mercy-Seat) called the <hi>Cherubims of Glory,</hi> i. e. of the Divine preſence, <hi>IX. Heb. 5.</hi> And all to ſignifie, that where God's ſacred Memorial is, there the Bleſſed Angels, out of Duty, give their attendance. And therefore the LXX. I obſerve, in this place, inſtead of <hi>before the Angel,</hi> have <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>before the face, or preſence of God:</hi> whoſe Miniſters the Angels were, and before whom the Vows men engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, being made; they were Witneſſes alſo and Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of their excuſes, or of their delays, to make them good.</p>
                     <p>As for the Vulgar Tranſlation of thoſe words <hi>[it is an errour;]</hi> which is this, <hi>there is no Providence;</hi> I have taken no notice of it; becauſe it doth not ſeem to be the genuine meaning: for why ſhould a man make any Vows; who believes no Providence over him? Unleſs we will ſay, that he might alter his Opinion afterwards; and ſo we may put both ſenſes together, thus: <hi>I was in an errour, there is no Providence; and therefore I need not trouble my ſelf about my Vows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 7.]</hi> In theſe words he concludes his Diſcourſe about Religion, with a repetition (as ſome take it) of the <hi>third</hi> Verſe: a little varied and enlarged. Which may be thus paraphraſed, according to our Tranſlation: <hi>To ſumm up all that concerns this matter; Since in a multitude of words, as well
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46873:52"/>as Dreams, there muſt needs be much vanity; therefore have a greater reverence of God, than to ſpeak any thing raſhly, or to make larger promiſes to Him, than thou art truly willing to make good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Hebrew the words run thus: <hi>But from a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Dreams</hi> (or <hi>when Dreams are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi>) <hi>both vanity and words are multiplied; therefore fear thou God.</hi> Which may have this meaning; they do but merely dream of God, and are not awakened to a lively ſenſe of Him; who make either thoſe vain excuſes, or thoſe idle promiſes: of which thou mayeſt not be guilty, poſſeſs thy ſoul with an awful dread of his Majeſty. This is exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Hebrew; if we take <hi>vanities</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto the excuſes of ignorance or error before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and <hi>Words</hi> unto <hi>Promiſes:</hi> and by <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Dreams</hi> underſtand, a great many concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning God; more like Dreams, than wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of Him.</p>
                     <p>Interpreters explain the words many other ways; whom the learned Reader may conſult: I have followed my own conjectures: And ſhall alſo propound another Tranſlation of the words, which ſeems to me very natural and eaſie; which is this: <hi>When, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Dreams, and vanities, and words, are multiplied; then fear thou God.</hi> That is, have a great care of thy ſelf, and let the dread of God overawe thee leſt thou offend, when thy head is hot and full of Dreams, and vain imaginations; which diſpoſe thee to ſpeak abundantly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 8.]</hi> As the foregoing Verſe concluded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about Religion; ſo this concludes the <hi>Third General</hi> Head, whereby he demonſtrates the vanity of all things; begun <hi>III. 16.</hi> Which he here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us, ſhould not too much diſturb, much leſs quite aſtoniſh us: becauſe God will ſet all right, in his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46873:53"/>due time. So he began it, <hi>III. 17.</hi> and ſo he here ends it, in this Verſe. Which hath ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the laſt part of it; which we tranſlate, <hi>He that is higher than the higheſt,</hi> &amp;c. Word for word, <hi>High above the high obſerveth.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in Hebrew, never ſignifies ſimply <hi>above;</hi> but always <hi>from above,</hi> or <hi>from on high:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſhould be tranſlated here, <hi>He that is high, from on high obſerveth.</hi> And then the only Queſtion is, who is meant by the <hi>high;</hi> whether God or his Vicegerent; the King here on Earth. I have expounded it of the latter; becauſe otherways the ſame thing muſt be ſaid over again immediately. Which is not unuſual indeed in Scripture; but where there is no neceſſity of it, and where the words will better bear another ſenſe, they are not to be ſo conſtrued. And the laſt word of the Verſe, will no way be ſo plain; as by referring it, both to the high perſon mentioned before, and to all his inferior Potentates and Judges; whom he obſerves from on high; that is, from his Throne, or from his Seat of Judgment. Where he ought to call them to an account, and examine any complaints that are made againſt them: or if he do not both he and they are obſerved by the ſupreme Judge of all; and ſhall be accountable to Him, whether they will or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 9.]</hi> And now he ſeems in this next Verſe, to make a tranſition to the IVth. <hi>General</hi> Head (mentioned in the beginning) concerning the Vanity of thoſe; who place their happineſs, in getting and heaping up a great deal of money.</p>
                     <p>It is an obſcure Verſe, both in its connection, and in ſome of its Phraſes: and therefore is diverſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Interpreters. To help out the connection, I have made bold to preface a little, and alſo to add ſuch a Concluſion, in my Paraphraſe upon it, as I took to be moſt agreeable to what follows, and to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46873:53"/>what went before. I have expreſſed alſo both ſenſes of the laſt Clauſe, which we render, <hi>the King is ſerved by the Field;</hi> but may more literally be tranſlated, <hi>the King is a Servant</hi> (or is, <hi>addicted</hi>) <hi>to the Field.</hi> For anciently the greateſt perſons did not think it below them to follow Husbandry (whoſe juſt praiſes <hi>Cicero</hi> hath given in his <hi>Offices,</hi> but eſpecially in his Book <hi>de Senectute</hi>) as we are taught by the Examples of <hi>Hiero, Philometor, Attalus, Archelaus, Cyrus</hi> the younger in prophane Story; and by the Example of King <hi>Uzziah</hi> in Scripture, <hi>2 Chron. XXII. 10.</hi> Which did not at all abate their courage, or dull their Wits; but only made the one more patient of toil and labour, and the other more ſolid and more ſerious. Whence it is that we find the greateſt Captains among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Camillus, Regulus, Fabius, Cato, Cincinnatus,</hi> were fetcht from the Plough: as <hi>Gideon</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was from the Threſhing-floor; and <hi>Eliſha</hi> called to the high Office of a Prophet, as he was driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the twelve Ploughs, his Father had going in the Field.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Tranſlation of theſe words is not to be deſpiſed; who (and he alone, as far as I can find) thinks they are capable of being rendred thus: <hi>By following Husbandry diligently, a man may grow ſo rich as to become a King. Melancthon</hi> alone tranſlates the whole Verſe thus, <hi>The King in the Earth, is above all for the Tillage of the Field.</hi> Where <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaith he, diſtinguiſhes a <hi>King</hi> from a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> A Tyrant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populates his Country, and lays all waſte; a good King cheriſhes his people, eſpecially honeſt Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Farmers: and loves to ſee them thrive, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all good Arts. The <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> I ſuppoſe, aimed at ſomething of this; though it be taken otherwiſe by thoſe that follow it. Agreeable to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46873:54"/>which is this memorable Paſſage in a <hi>Perſian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quoted by Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> (in his Notes upon <hi>Abul Faragii</hi> p. <hi>202, 203.</hi>) that in that Country <q>they kept a ſolemn Feaſt every Year; wherein the King deſcended from his Throne, laid aſide his Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, threw the Veil from his Face, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the moſt ordinary people, even with Country Swains and Husbandmen: with whom he ate, ſaying; <hi>I am one of you; nor can the World ſubſiſt without Tillage, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by your pains;</hi> and that Tillage ſubſiſts, it <hi>is owing to the King; ſo that neither of us, being able to ſubſiſt without the other, we are, as it were, individual Brethren.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are thoſe that comprehend Paſtorage, as well as Tillage, under theſe words; becauſe the antient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were Shepherds. But there is no need of this; and Husbandry or Gardening was far more ancient: even as old as <hi>Adam;</hi> and after the Floud we find <hi>Noah</hi> thus employed; as <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo was in ſucceeding times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 10.]</hi> The latter end of this Verſe, runs thus in the Hebrew Text: <hi>Who ſo loveth</hi> (viz. <hi>Silver</hi>) <hi>reaps no fruit of his abundance:</hi> i. e. doth not enjoy it, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> expounds it; which is very often the miſerable condition of worldly-minded men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 11.]</hi> The latter end of this Verſe alſo, is capable of contrary ſenſes; which I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe; but ſhall not give an account of here, becauſe I ſee theſe Annotations already grow too large. For which cauſe I will not note particularly every thing that is obſervable in the following Verſes; but only touch upon ſome of them, under this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That he ſeems to demonſtrate the vanity of that ſort of happineſs, which men place in Riches, from <hi>Ten</hi> Conſiderations. The <hi>two</hi> firſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46873:54"/>in the <hi>tenth</hi> Verſe, That the deſires of ſuch men are unſatiable; and the more unſatiable they are, the leſs they enjoy of what they have.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> in the 11th. Verſe, that if they will enjoy it, the more they have, the more others muſt alſo have of it; and the pleaſure of this is very ſmall; being no more, than to behold a great many people eat and drink at their Coſt.</p>

                     <p>The laſt Clauſe of this Verſe, runs thus word for word in the Hebrew: <hi>Sorrow is multiplied</hi> (or <hi>there is much ſorrow</hi>) <hi>and ſickneſs, and wrath:</hi> the force of which I hope I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe: and ſhall only note, that the first word <hi>ſorrow</hi> (as was obſerved Chap.

For being applied
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46873:55"/>to the Sea, it ſignifies ſuch a boiling rage, as makes it foam. There is another word indeed which we render <hi>hot diſpleaſure:</hi> but this is joined with it <hi>(XXXVIII. Pſal. 1.)</hi> as equivalent to it, or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it.</p>

                        <hi>[f] V. 8. what hath]</hi> There is ſo great a difficulty in this Verſe, that I did not know how to connect it with the foregoing; but by taking the latter part of the Sentence, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, <hi>What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is there between him</hi> (viz the man before named) <hi>and the poor that knows how to walk before the living?</hi> i. e. the poor man who hath ſo much skill, as to know to live well, is infinitely to be preferred before him; whoſe Wiſdom ſtill leaves him ſuch a Fool, that it doth not reſtrain his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous appetites. And this ſuits well with the next words (v. <hi>9.</hi>) where the <hi>ſight of the eyes,</hi> being oppoſed to the <hi>wandring of the deſire;</hi> it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to take it for the fixedneſs of a mans mind, to reſt ſatisfied in what is before him: that is, in things preſent.</p>
                     <p>Or the words may admit of this conſtruction (which is come into my mind, ſince I wrote the Paraphraſe) <hi>What excellence is there in the Wiſe man</hi> (that is, in the opinion of the wretch before-mentioned, there is none) <hi>more than in a Fool, eſpecially if he be poor,</hi> &amp;c. That is, to all other miſeries of theſe rich Churls, this is commonly added, That they are very ignorant of what is moſt truly valuable; having no eſteem of the wiſeſt man in the World, no more than a of a Fool. Nay, they prefer a rich Fool, before a poor Wiſe man: who knows how to carry himſelf ſo decently, that he is not afraid to appear before any man living. This is a great ſottiſhneſs (v. <hi>9.</hi>) and breeds no leſs ſorrow; to be led by blind Appetites, and not by Reaſon and Judgment. For ſo the first words of the <hi>ninth</hi> Verſe, may be interpreted: <hi>Better it is to underſtand aright, than to follow after ones deſires.</hi>

                        <hi>[g] V. 10. That which hath been]</hi> The ſence that I have given of the beginning of this Verſe (taking the firſt word for an Interrogation, and <hi>name</hi> for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46873:59"/>renown, as is common in Scripture) ſeems to me to be the moſt ſimple; and moſt agreeable to the whole Diſcourſe. And it is that which <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Although a man grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yet it is known that he is but a man; and he cannot contend with that, which is ſtronger than himſelf.</hi> That is, he cannot govern events. But I ſhall mention two other Interpretations, which ſome give of it. One is this, <hi>As he was made at firſt, ſo his Name was given him;</hi> i. e. the Name of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſignifying that he was taken out of the Earth, and therefore mortal. The other is this; <hi>He that hath been, his Name is called already;</hi> that is, his memory is aboliſhed together with himſelf. This is <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s ſenſe; but is not agreeable to the Hebrew Phraſe, his <hi>Name is called;</hi> for that in the Scripture ſignifies rather the contrary, <hi>viz. fame,</hi> and honourable mention, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it word for word out of the Hebrew, in the Paraphraſe. The common Interpretation may be found in all commentators, which is this; that <hi>God hath appointed what every man ſhall be; whether rich or poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore it is in vain for them to contrive, as they do, to be other than what they are:</hi> For it is to endeavour to alter that which is immutably ſettled by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 11. ſeeing there be]</hi> This Verſe ſumms up all this matter about Riches; or, as others will have it, the whole foregoing Diſcourſe, concerning all thoſe <hi>four</hi> things, wherein men place their happineſs: wherether <hi>Wiſdom, Pleaſure, Honour,</hi> or <hi>Wealth.</hi> Which draw ſo <hi>many,</hi> and ſo <hi>great</hi> (for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word includes both) inconveniences along with them; as ſufficiently demonſtrate a man is ſtill to ſeek for the ſatisfaction of his deſires, if he look no further.</p>

And ſo they would have the laſt Verſe, to be an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the following Diſcourſe in the next Chapter: where he ſhows, wherein that true and ſolid happineſs lies, which Mankind vainly purſue in the forenamed enjoyments. But I have connected it with what goes before in this Chapter: as the Particle <hi>(for)</hi> in the beginning of it, ſhows it ought to be.</p>

Such are all the Doctrines that begin this Chapter (quite oppoſite to the common Opinions of the World) that <hi>a good name is to be preferred before precious Ointment, and the day of ones death, before ones birth-day: mourning before feaſting; ſadneſs before laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; rebukes before commendations; the end

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a]</hi> Among all the Maxims of true Wiſdom and Piety, which are to be learnt, for the ſettlement of our mind in peace and tranquility, notwithſtanding the <hi>vanity</hi> that is in all things, <hi>Solomon</hi> recommends to us in the firſt place; the care of that, which men fooliſhly loſe; by minding nothing but heaping up Wealth, or pleaſing themſelves in a voluptuous life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>to acquire a good Name.</hi> Which nothing but a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous uſe of all things, can beſtow upon us; and when we have it, will give us a ſingular delight at preſent, and embalm our memory when we are laid in our Graves.</p>
                     <p>Which good Name (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> obſerves) conſiſts in <hi>two</hi> things: in the approbation of our own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces judging aright; and in the approbation of other men, who alſo rightly judge. Both which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God; that we ſhould do right things, and that others ſhould approve of what is rightly done. Unto which they are bound, for <hi>two</hi> Reaſons; that the difference of Vertue and Vice may be made the more conſpicuous; and that others may be taught by Examples. He requires therefore that infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be caſt out of Society, and that they be honoured, whoſe manners are without infamy. Now ſince ſuch approbation is a Divine Ordinance, it is manifeſt we may deſire this Glory; and, by the ſame reaſon, that we must avoid all ſcandal, and take care that we may be commended.</p>
                     <p>Which <hi>Solomon</hi> here compares to a precious Ointment, becauſe nothing was more grateful and refreſhing in thoſe Eastern Countries: and therefore uſed not only in Feaſts, but at other times, when they were weary or languiſhing; for comforting the brain, recreating the ſpirits, chearing the countenance, ſuppling the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46873:66"/>joints; and for other ſervices tending to health, as well as pleaſure. Which made Ointments to be held in the greateſt price and eſtimation; and to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among the Treaſures of Kings, <hi>2 King. XX. 12. XXXIX. Iſai. 2.</hi> Suitable to this is that of <hi>Pindar, A Bath of warm Water doth not ſo refreſh the tired Bones, as Glory.</hi> And this of <hi>Thucidydes,</hi> that <hi>Honour is the nouriſhment and food of an old man;</hi> who lives upon the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he hath gotten by worthy Deeds, which will make Death not unwelcome to him. So the latter part of this Verſe muſt be underſtood, with reference to a well-ſpent life; for otherways it would be only a diſcontented Saying, like that of the Heathen, <hi>The beſt thing is not to be born, the next beſt to die preſently.</hi> Unto which Doctrine (as <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> well ſpeaks) the Church is a Stranger.</p>
                     <p>I cannot well paſs over this Verſe, without obſerving, what all Interpreters note; an elegant <hi>Paranomaſia</hi> (as they call it) that is, a near affinity both in the Letters and in the ſound, of theſe two Hebrew words <hi>Schem</hi> Name, and <hi>Schemen</hi> Oil or Ointment: as there is afterward, <hi>v. 5, 6.</hi> between three other words, <hi>Shir</hi> a Song, <hi>Sirim</hi> Thorns, and <hi>Sir</hi> a Pot. Which being found alſo in ſeveral other parts of the Bible, it ſhows that ſuch alluſions are not unſeemly, nor ought to be cenſured as affectations; if they be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly uſed, and wiſely, gravely and decently ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Diſcourſe; not fulſomely, upon every occaſion, obtruded.</p>
                     <p>[b]. <hi>V. 2.</hi>] Now the Wiſe man knowing that nothing ſtirs us up more powerfully to a religious life, than the frequent remembrance of our mortality (which alas! we are not willing to think of) he next adviſes him that would be happy, to embrace all occaſions that may put him in mind of it. The <hi>Meditation of Death,</hi> being as was anciently ſaid, <hi>the very Abridgment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46873:66"/>of all Philoſophy.</hi> All the Precepts of Wiſdom, they thought, were comprized in this; and therefore no wonder <hi>Solomon</hi> not only begins with it, but preſſes it ſo largely as he doth in the following Verſes: to the end, that we may make our life not only a <hi>Meditation,</hi> but an <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Death; which in the Chriſtian Language is called <hi>Mortification.</hi> In ſhort, the thoughts of Death will, without any other Teacher (if we keep it always in mind) inſtruct us in all thoſe Vertues, which will procure us a Good Name; ſome of which I have touched in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe. And the more healthful we are, the more we had need to charge our ſelves with the thoughts of it; becauſe that is apt to make us forget it. So I have taken <hi>chai,</hi> not merely for <hi>living;</hi> but <hi>lively,</hi> vigorous, luſty and flouriſhing, as we tranſlate it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>XXXVIII. Pſal. 19.</hi>

                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> In the Explication of this Verſe, I have touched upon another ſenſe of the firſt word of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: which ſignifies not only <hi>ſorrow,</hi> but anger or indignation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: by which ſome expound this Verſe.

But this is mentioned v. <hi>5.</hi> and therefore I take it not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here.</p>
                     <p>The truth of the latter part of this Verſe is admirably explained by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>2 Corinth. VII. 11.</hi> As for the Phraſe I ſhall only note, that <hi>an ill look</hi> is an exact Tranſlation into our Language, of the Hebrew Phraſe, which is here tranſlated <hi>ſadneſs of the countenance.</hi> Now a man may <hi>look ill</hi> not only by ſickneſs, but, by reaſon of any other thing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him (as we find in the Caſe of <hi>Nehemiah, II. 2.</hi>) ſome of which I have expreſſed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> This compariſon between rebuke and flattery, <hi>Corranus</hi> thinks is continued alſo in this Verſe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he paraphraſes in this manner; <hi>As Thorns put under a Pot, and kindled, make ſuch a crackling, as if they would ſet the whole houſe on fire, and by their noiſe raiſe an expectation of the greateſt flame; but preſently end in ſmoke and vapours: ſo ſenſeleſs Flatterers make a great buzzing in mens ears, and blow up their minds, extolling them to Heaven with their Praiſes; but in truth make them not one whit the better,</hi> &amp;c. But I do not ſee how the word <hi>laughter</hi> can be well applied to this; and therefore I have omitted it, and only thought fit here to mention it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> The connection of this Verſe with the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a little obſcure; unleſs we tranſlate it, as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> doth (following <hi>Munſter</hi>) <hi>A Wiſe man deſpiſeth calumny, and a mind that can be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Gifts:</hi> Which is an excellent Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well ſuited to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s purpoſe.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46873:67"/>but rather in the ſenſe of <hi>giving diſturbance,</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mad,</hi> as we tranſlate it.

                     <p>But I have not confined the ſenſe to this; the Hebrew word <hi>Oſchek</hi> ſignifying all ſorts of oppreſſions, as I have noted before, either by fraud or by force. And the eaſieſt ſenſe of the Verſe ſeems to me, that which I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe; by connecting it with Ver. <hi>5.</hi> as a reaſon why we ought to hearken even to the rebukes of the Wiſe; that we may acquire a good habit of mind, able to hold out againſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the one hand, and bribery on the other: which none can do, who is not very vertuous.</p>
                     <p>And in this Expoſition I have taken <hi>Wiſe</hi> as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> doth; not for one that is <hi>perfect,</hi> but for a <hi>Proficient:</hi> who hath not yet ſettled wiſe Principles in his mind.</p>
                     <p>It is poſſible alſo that <hi>Solomon</hi> may have reſpect to the oppreſſions which men generally indure, in a State ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed. Which raiſes a just indignation, and holy warmth of zeal in the beſt of men: but if care be not taken to repreſs the violence of that perturbation, which this is apt to give us, it may turn into fury; and make us behave our ſelves towards our Superiors, as men out of their Wits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:46873:68"/>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> I have connected this Verſe with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; though it may be taken alone by it ſelf. And the word <hi>dabar,</hi> ſignifying either <hi>ſpeech</hi> or thing, ſome (following the <hi>Vulgar</hi>) interpret this of the care that ought to be taken, in the <hi>Epilogue</hi> or cloſe of an Oration (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks) rather than in the beginning or Preface to it; that, as we are wont to ſay, we may come off well, and leave a ſting in the minds of thoſe that hear it. But this is ſo wide from the Wiſe mans purpoſe, that I do not think fit to ſet down an excellent Diſcourſe of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſenſe of the words, Lib. VIII. <hi>de Augm. Scient. Parab. 10.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we expound it of <hi>things,</hi> it is but a dilute ſenſe to ſay, that <hi>a thing perfected is better than a thing begun.</hi> Others therefore take it to be the ſame with that, <hi>Finis coronat Opus:</hi> which is true, but doth not complete the ſenſe; unleſs we underſtand it in this manner; that the <hi>Concluſion of all things is to be expected, before we judge of them.</hi> For whilſt they are growing and coming on, they appear with a quite different face, from what they have, and when they are gone and ſhall be no more.</p>
                     <p>In the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>patient in Spirit,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly one that is long before he grow angry, or fall into any paſſion; who is oppoſed to <hi>proud in ſpirit,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>high-mindedneſs</hi> (as the word ſignifies) which makes mens paſſion riſe and ſwell haſtily. It may have relation to the former part, and be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner: <hi>A patient man and ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſpatches buſineſs better, than a proud, huffing and bluſtering Spirit: whoſe paſſion ſo diſorders his mind, and indiſpoſes it for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, that he ſeldom brings them to a good iſſue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or thus, <hi>A proud man is a Boutefeau, who begins the fray: but the patient in ſpirit is the man that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46873:68"/>muſt end it (if ever it be well ended) and that is much the better work, and the greater honour to him, who is employed in it, and effects it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, which is ſtill clearer, we ought to attend to the end of a thing with patience: becauſe it cannot be known what it will prove, nor whither it tends, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: and we ſhould be the more prone to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſpirit, if we would expect the iſſue of every thing. Thus <hi>Corranus</hi> paraphraſes upon the words moſt excellently; but a little too long. <hi>It is no ſmall part of Wiſdom, to judge of things, and of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs propoſed to us, ſlowly and maturely,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for we ſee frequently that inconſiderate men, finding a thing very hard and difficult in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and never thinking how profitable and pleaſant the iſſue may prove, immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond; and out of an impatience, ſhall I ſay, or raſhneſs of mind, deſiſt from the moſt excellent Enterprizes; and many times betake themſelves to worſe. From which raſhneſs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy he will be very far removed, who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Divine Wiſdom, waits for the deſired and happy Concluſion of his Affairs. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this nothing contributes more, than a ſlow, conſtant and patient mind, that can endure la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains: which ſtedfaſtly and quietly conſidering how fruitful the end may be which he affects, will not ſuffer himſelf by any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, trouble or wearineſs which he meets withal in the beginning, to be drawn from his purpoſe. Far different from thoſe, who out of a proud, arrogant humour, think it is baſeneſs, and unbecoming a gallant man, to attend upon the flow and leiſurely progreſſes of things, and to expect their events.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he; which ſenſe I have not neglected in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe; but comprized it, among the reſt; and it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46873:69"/>thus, in part, expreſſed more briefly by a wiſe and good man in that Age; when he told his Friend (who was undone becauſe he would not mind it) that <hi>he was like an unskilful Player at Tennis, ever running after the Ball; whereas an expert Player, will ſtand ſtill to obſerve and diſcern, where the Ball will light, or where it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; and there with ſmall travel will let it fall on his Racket, or on his hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9, 10.]</hi> Theſe two Verſes depend on the foregoing ſhowing that <hi>anger</hi> is inconſiſtent with Wiſdom; and ſo is <hi>murmuring</hi> and repining at the hardſhip we meet withal in evil times. And therefore, as the ſame <hi>Corranus</hi> well gloſſes, <hi>let us not throw the cauſes of our anger upon the times;</hi> but blame our ſelves, who at all times, if we want <hi>meekneſs of Wiſdom,</hi> ſhall grow angry upon the moſt frivolous occaſions; and not only let looſe the Reins of our anger, but of all other Vices.</p>
                     <p>But I think this advice, <hi>v. 10.</hi> is not merely to be reſtrained to this, but extended unto all ſorts of diſcontent, which are apt to make us complain of our preſent condition; and ſo to admire what is paſt, as not to mind what is preſent: as if they had nothing but what was good, who lived before us; and we nothing but what is naught, in theſe days. Whereas, they complained juſt as we do now; and that of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidydes</hi> was true then, as it ever will be, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>the preſent is always burthenſome.</hi> Becauſe, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> obſerves, we have a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe of preſent incommodities; but know what was heretofore only by report: and ſo we praiſe thoſe ancient times, but do not like our own; which may be as good. This we are ſure of, that <hi>all times have their troubles:</hi> and it is the part of a wiſe and good man, to bear them, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them by a fooliſh Cure. According to that

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: <hi>let not one evil be remedied by another.</hi> And that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: <hi>What por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things fall to thy ſhare, take it; and do not grumble, nor be vexed at it.</hi> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as <hi>Corranus</hi> gloſſes again, that <hi>a truly wiſe man is never ſo tranſported with admiration of ancient times, as to deſpiſe the preſent; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out thoſe were the Golden, theſe the Iron Ages: nor will he ſolicitouſly enquire into the cauſes of what was then and what is now; when this is certain, that Vertue is the only cauſe of happineſs, and Vice of infelicity; which, in what time ſoever we fall, always produce the ſame effect.</hi> And to imagine that the ancient times had no evil in them, and ours no good, is the conceit of man that judges inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For our eyes ought not to be ſo fixed upon the preſent calamities of our days, as blindly to overlook all the good: nor is the ancient felicity to be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, as not to remember, that they alſo conflicted with many Tempeſts, and perhaps greater than we, as their frequent complaints of their times do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie. He therefore that is wiſe and fears God, will make account (as the truth is) that it is in our own choice, by his Grace, whether the times ſhall be good or bad; for if he live well, they cannot be bad to him; as on the contrary, they cannot be good, if he live wickedly.</p>
                     <p>I am the longer in theſe Obſervations, becauſe they are things of mighty moment: but moſt of the reſt I ſhall contract, as much as is poſſible.</p>

                        <hi>[k] V. 11.]</hi> Moſt take this Verſe, as denoting their happineſs, who have Riches, as well as <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> which commonly is deſpiſed without <hi>Wealth.</hi> But the words may bear another conſtruction (which I have not neglected, becauſe it agrees well with what
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46873:70"/>follows) that <hi>Wiſdom is equal to an Inheritance; nay, much to be preferred before it.</hi> For they may be thus tranſlated, <hi>Both Wiſdom and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance are profitable for men in this world; but eſpecially Wiſdom.</hi> Or, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> renders the laſt Clauſe, <hi>Et Reſiduum eſt videnti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Solem,</hi> and there is a remainder to thoſe that ſee the Sun. That is, when all things in this World fail us, the fruits of Wiſdom only remain with us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 12.]</hi> This is further explained in this Verſe: Where it will be needleſs to do more than barely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the word we render <hi>defence</hi> is <hi>ſhadow</hi> in the Hebrew; which in their Language ſignifies protection, and comfort, <hi>XIX. Gen. 8. For this cauſe, they come under the ſhadow of my Roof;</hi> i. e. that they might be ſecure from violence. <hi>XIV. Numb. 9. Their ſhadow</hi> (i. e. protection) <hi>is departed from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 13, 14.]</hi> Here follows an admirable Advice, to comply with our preſent condition, and ſuit our mind unto it: Becauſe we cannot bring things to the bent of our own mind, and therefore had better ſtudy to conform our mind to our condition, whatſoever it be; whether proſperity or adverſity. Into which the Divine Wiſdom hath divided our life, and ſo proportioned them one to the other; that none can juſtly find fault with his Divine diſpoſal; nor, all things conſidered, tell how to mend them, and order them better.</p>
                     <p>So I have underſtood the laſt Clauſe of v. <hi>14.</hi> in which is the only difficulty: <hi>find nothing after him.</hi> Which Words <hi>(after him)</hi> ſome refer unto God, and make the ſenſe to be, that <hi>after Him</hi> (or beſide Him) <hi>a man ſhall find nothing certain:</hi> and therefore it is beſt to depend upon Him alone. Which I have not taken notice of in the Paraphraſe, and therefore mention here. Others refer <hi>after him</hi> unto
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46873:70"/>man; and that <hi>two</hi> ways (which it may be fit just to ſet down) Some tranſlate it thus, <hi>For this end, that man may find out none of thoſe things; which ſhall befall him hereafter:</hi> and ſo, being perfectly ignorant of what is to come, neither preſume in proſperity, nor deſpair in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Others thus (which is <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Gloſs) <hi>that man loſing in time of adverſity, what he had gotten in proſperity, might not adhere too much to the things of this World. Melancthon</hi> alone interprets <hi>find nothing,</hi> in this ſenſe, <hi>that he might not betake himſelf unto unallowed courſes:</hi> but in proſperity keep himſelf within the Bounds of his vocation, and not be carried beyond it by vain curioſity; and in adverſity expect the help of God, in the uſe of ſuch remedies as he hath ordained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 15.]</hi> This Verſe may be either joined with the precedent, or with the following: I have connected it with both, in my Paraphraſe upon it, and v. <hi>16.</hi> where I have attended to the Scope of the Wiſe man in this Chapter; and accordingly interpreted that and the 17th. Verſe; which will admit of ſeveral other Expoſitions.</p>
                     <p>They are commonly expounded of Publick Justice; which ought to be, neither too rigid, nor too remiſs and negligent. Inſomuch that <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s words are, <hi>non dubium eſt;</hi> there is no doubt he ſpeaks of Political Justice, which governs the things of this life: and conſists in a mean, between cruelty and negligence. Too much ſeverity becomes cruelty; as it was in <hi>Aurelian:</hi> and too much indulgence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms men in wickedneſs, as it was in the days of <hi>Arcadius.</hi> A good Governour, like <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> takes a middle courſe; and doth not ſeek that middle with too much ſubtilty: but rather, as in God, lets mercy prevail over judgment. The like admonition, ſaith he, is ſubjoined about Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46873:71"/>for, as too much ſeverity becomes cruelty, ſo too much Wiſdom, that is ſubtilty, becomes cavilling ſophiſtry, and cheating. And thus he interprets ver. <hi>17.</hi> that a Magiſtrate ſhould not tolerate enormous Vices.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> alone, as far as I have read, makes the 16th. Verſe, <hi>Be not righteous over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,</hi> &amp;c. to be the Objection of a Wordling; who takes that for exceſs of Duty, which brings any damage, or worldly deſtruction upon him. Which is anſwered, ſaith he, in v. <hi>17. Be not wicked overmuch,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the fears, and from thence the prudential (but oftentimes very impious) practices of the Worldling, are the more probable Bath, to the moſt haſty ruines, <hi>Vid.</hi> Anſw. to <hi>Cawdry,</hi> Chap. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not coherent, in my Opinion, with the reſt of the Chapter; and therefore I have followed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Opinion of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen:</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it of heat and zeal, more than needs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon and diſcretion: Which, as it makes all the Schiſms in the World, ſo produces a great many other evils. And the ſame paſſion, ſaith he, is both about righteouſneſs, and about Wiſdom: <gap reason="foreign">

Which Interpretation is in part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> L. VIII. <hi>de Augment. Scient.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46873:71"/>befals men eminent for Courage, or Justice; ſometime ſuddenly, ſometime foreſeen afar off. But if <hi>Prudence</hi> be alſo added to their other accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that is, if they be wary and watchful over their own ſafety; then they gain thus much, that their ſudden deſtruction proceeds from counſels altogether hidden and obſcure; by which both envy may be avoided, and their ruine fall upon them unprovided. As for that <hi>nimium (overmuch)</hi> which is ſet down in the <hi>Parable</hi> (ſince they are not the words of ſome <hi>Periander,</hi> but of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who now and then notes the evils in mens life, but never commands them) it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not of Vertue it ſelf (in which there is no <hi>nimium</hi>) but of a vain and invidious affectation, and oſtentation thereof.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>A Point ſomething reſembling this, the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> intimates in a Paſſage touching <hi>Lepidus;</hi> ſetting it down as a Miracle, that he had never been the Author of any ſervile Sentence, and yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſafe in ſuch cruel times.</q>
                        <hi>This thought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>often comes into my mind; whether theſe things be governed by Fate; or whether it lies alſo in our own power, to fleer an even courſe, free both from danger and from indignity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween deformed flattery, and abrupt and ſullen contumacy.</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Character of a Governour, as well as of a man, must be fetcht from the constant strain, and bent of his actions; and not from particular facts. For he is a good Governour that always intends to do right, though he ſometimes miſcarry (as <hi>David</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46873:72"/>the forenamed <hi>Joſiah</hi>) and he is an ill Governour, who hath no ſuch deſign, but quite contrary; though ſometime he do well, as <hi>Cambyſes.</hi> The difference therefore muſt be taken from their perpetual will and inclination.</p>
                     <p>There are thoſe who connect this Verſe, with the next rather than the foregoing: but I have referred it to both, and not unfitly I think; as may be ſeen in the Paraphraſe upon v. <hi>21.</hi>

For <hi>firſt</hi> there follows <hi>vexation and diſquiet of mind:</hi> humane Affairs being ſo full of treachery and ingratitude, that if there could be procured a Magical Glaſs, in which we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hatreds, and whatſoever malicious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are any where raiſed up againſt us, it would be better for us, if ſuch a Glaſs were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with throne away and broken in pieces. For things of this nature, are like the murmurs of the leaves of Trees, which in a ſhort time vaniſh. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This curioſity loads the mind too much with ſuſpicions,</hi> and ungrounded jealouſies: which is the moſt capital Enemy to counſels; and renders them inconſtant and involved. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſame curioſity doth ſometime <hi>ſix thoſe evils which otherways of themſelves would paſs by us and fly away.</hi> For it is a dangerous thing to irritate the conſciences of men; who, if they think themſelves to ly undiſcovered, are eaſily
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46873:73"/>changed for the better; but, if they perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be detected, drive out one miſchief by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore it was deſervedly esteemed the highest Wiſdom in <hi>Pompey the Great;</hi> that he instantly burnt all <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s Papers, unperuſed by himſelf, or ſuffered to be ſeen by others.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some take this Verſe to ſpeak of thoſe, who willingly lend their ears to Informers and Detractors; who will bring them what is ſaid abroad, whether true or falſe. And therefore, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſince there is no man but who offends ſometimes, not thou thy ſelf excepted, do not hearken unto thoſe who reckon up other mens faults; lest thou hear thy own, from thoſe that are of thy Family. Thus <hi>Maldonate.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[ſ] V. 23.]</hi> Here he ſeems to reſume his Diſcourſe, in the beginning of the Book, concerning the ſhortneſs of humane understanding; and the difficulty of finding the truth and the reaſon of things. But no account can be given, why he thus ſtarts from his Subject, on a ſudden, without any coherence. And therefore I have endeavoured to give another account of this, and the following Verſe: Which I have ſo interpreted, that they may be knit to the foregoing. I cannot ſay that herein I have followed any Guide, but my own Judgment: which led me to think this to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Diſcourſe. But they that diſlike my connection, must rest ſatisfied (as far as I can ſee) with that of <hi>Corranus</hi> (which hath more colour for it, than any other) who takes this Verſe to be a Preface to what the Wiſe man had to add concerning the ſubtil Arts of Women to draw men in, if they be not exceeding cautious. Their wits being ſo verſatile, their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo ſly, and their allurements ſo many, that he profeſſes he found them inexplicable; though he had ſpared no pains to penetrate into them. This he makes the ſenſe of ver. <hi>23, 24, 25.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>[t] V. 26.]</hi> And then, in this Verſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> gives an account of the danger they are in; who ſuffer themſelves to be inſnared by the Arts of naughty Women (who are ſo numerous, that he adviſes him, who would be good, to be very cautious how he enters into familiarity with that Sex) who have brought ſore calamities upon the greateſt men; ſuch as <hi>Samſon, David</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and many other beſides <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf. The next Verſe I have made to relate to that. The two words we tranſlate <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>nets</hi> (to which he compares her <hi>heart,</hi> i. e. her invention, devices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) both ſignifie <hi>nets.</hi> Only the former ſignifies the Nets of <hi>Hunters;</hi> the latter, the Nets (or <hi>Draggs</hi> rather of <hi>Fiſhermen, (XXVI. Ezek. 5.)</hi> as the LXX. diſtinguiſh them. The former indeed is applied alſo to <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> in this Book, <hi>IX. 11.</hi> and therefore the truer difference perhaps is, that the former ſignifies <hi>finer,</hi> the latter <hi>courſer,</hi> but stronger <hi>Nets:</hi> ſuch as cannot be broken, but will certainly deſtroy; as the <hi>Root,</hi> from whence <hi>Cherem</hi> comes, denotes. Both theſe words are in the <hi>Plural</hi> Number to denote, the vaſt multitudes that they catch; and the innumerable ways they have to entangle them, and hold them faſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[u] V. 28.] Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> interprets this Verſe altogether of their Chaſtity; after this manner: <hi>I have found a chaſte man, but never a chaſte woman:</hi> And, indeed, of that he is ſpeaking, which makes this ſenſe not unreaſonable: though I have not ſo reſtrained it, nor do I think this is to be lookt upon, as the true Character of Women, in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in all Ages, and Countries; but of ſuch only as <hi>Solomon</hi> was acquainted withal; and of thoſe in that, and the neighbouring Nations; eſpecially of Women there excelling in beauty, which commonly betrayed them to their ruine, and to the ruine of others; without an extraordinary Grace to preſerve them.</p>

                        <hi>[x] V. 29.]</hi> In the beginning of this Verſe, <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> thinks, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks not of the firſt creation of man, but of the Rule of mens actions, which God propoſed to them: The ſenſe being, as if he had ſaid, <hi>God inſtituted a good Order how men ſhould behave themſelves in all things; but they contrive how to go beyond their Bounds.</hi> As <hi>David,</hi> for inſtance, had many Wives of great beauty; but he would not be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another mans. <hi>Antony.</hi> had a great power, but he would be a Monarch: which is the fault of many other Great Men.</p>
                     <p>This I have not altogether neglected; and alſo taken notice of <hi>de Dieu</hi>'s Interpretation of the laſt words of the Verſe, <hi>Men ſought out the thoughts of the great or mighty:</hi> taking <hi>Rabbim</hi> for <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates.</hi> That is, not contented with his own condition, <hi>he affected to be like the Angels, nay like God.</hi>

But we may ſay as <hi>Malachi</hi> doth <hi>(I. 9.) this hath been by means of your own ſelves;</hi> and as this Wiſe man elſewhere <hi>(Prov. XIX. 3.)

                        <hi>[a] V. 1.]</hi> To the advices he had given in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, he now adds ſome new ones; the firſt of which is this; that <hi>the Wiſdom which will make us happy in this World, muſt not make us moroſe and ſupercilious, ſevere and rigorous; but kind and benign, gentle and eaſie.</hi> And the more we know, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ought to be: and, by the very cheerfulneſs and pleaſantneſs of our countenance, invite others to us; and not by our frowning, forbid them, or make them afraid to approach us.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be the meaning of the <hi>firſt</hi> Verſe; in my Paraphraſe upon which, I have had reſpect to ſeveral acceptations of the ſeveral Words, which it will be too long here to give an account of. They that will conſult Interpreters will find how they vary; and therefore I ſhall only mention the Expoſition of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> upon the latter part of the Verſe (which is not commonly known) which following the LXX, he thus tranſlates: <hi>Wiſdom is the light of a mans countenance; but a pertinacious</hi> (or impudent, obſtinate) <hi>perſon is worthy of hatred.</hi> Which he explains in this manner, that Wiſdom which can judge aright, when ſeverity is profitable, or when lenity will do beſt, when it is fit to make War, when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46873:78"/>to be quiet; brings a man great gladneſs; but a pertinacious perſon, who is ſtiff and obſtinate in his Opinion; and will not hearken to thoſe that give him good counſel, but follows the motions of his own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and obeys his paſſions, deſtroys himſelf and others. As the pertinacious humour, for inſtance, of <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Demonſthenes</hi> was moſt pernicious unto all <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> This pertinacious humour ſhows it ſelf oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in oppoſing the Sovereign Authority: whereby men create to themſelves and others, great troubles in this World. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes men in the next place (deſiring them not to diſlike the counſel becauſe a King gives it) to live in dutiful ſubjection to their Prince; as a ſingular means of leading a happy life. For it is hard to ſay, whether the Prudence and Juſtice of a Sovereign, in ruling well; or the humble and peaceable ſpirit of the people in complying with the eſtabliſhed Orders; contribute most to the publick Welfare. Certain it is, that it is much ſafer and eaſier (as well as more honest) to ſubmit and be quiet, than to contend and unſettle the peace of Kingdoms; though Princes do not govern as they ought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancthon</hi> makes this Verſe to contain two Precepts (as the LXX alſo ſeems to do) in this manner: <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Commandment of the King; and the word of the Oath of God.</hi> A Sentence, ſaith he, exceeding worthy of conſideration and remembrance: in which he commands us to obſerve the Command of the King; but with this reſtriction, that we obſerve the Law of God, and do nothing contrary unto that. For he calls the Law the <hi>Oath of God;</hi> becauſe God made the Sanction of it, in promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with an Oath. But this Interpretation wholly neglects one word in the Hebrew, <hi>viz. al:</hi> and it draws both <hi>dibrath</hi> and <hi>ſhebuath Elohim</hi> from their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46873:79"/>ordinary and uſual ſenſe, to a meaning that is forced and strained. For which reaſon another Expoſition is not natural; which makes this indeed one Precept; but instead of taking the latter part of it for an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> to obſerve it, turns it into a <hi>reſtriction</hi> of it; in this manner: <hi>Keep the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but according to the Oath of God;</hi> that is, as far as Religion and the Faith we owe to the great Lord of all will ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>This is true, but not the true ſenſe of the Hebrew word for <hi>Oath;</hi> which ſome would have relate to the Covenant made with God in Circumciſion; which is still further off from the buſineſs than the Notion which <hi>Melancthon</hi> had of it. Our Tranſlation is the plainest and most literal; be obedient to the King, <hi>and that in regard</hi> (or becauſe of the matter) <hi>of the Oath,</hi> to which <hi>God</hi> is a Witneſs, and a ſevere Revenger of the breach of it. From which a modern Interpreter doth not much vary: whoſe words it will not be unprofitable to ſet down in this place; which run thus in Engliſh. <hi>Regard the Kings mouth,</hi> i. e. Do whatſoever comes out of his mouth; whatſoever he commandeth and appointeth, out of that Authority which he hath by Divine Ordinance: <hi>and chiefly the intention of the Oath of God</hi> (ſo he tranſlates the latter part of the Verſe) "that is the Oath whereby every one citeth God as his Witneſs and Judge, that with a good Conſcience he will obey the King; becauſe God hath ſo commanded. Thus <hi>Joh. Coch.</hi> Which <hi>Oath</hi> is either <hi>tacit</hi> the very being in the condition of a Subject, carrying with it (as the late Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> ſpeaks) by implication, a <hi>ſilent</hi> Oath of Fidelity and due Obedience) or <hi>expreſs,</hi> in the direct Form of an Oath, which Princes have, for their better ſecurity, been wont to exact of their Subjects. There is an ancient Form, ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46873:79"/>in <hi>Vegetius,</hi> of the Oath wherein the Souldiery bound themſelves to the Chriſtian Emperours: <hi>By God, and by Chriſt, and by the holy Ghoſt, and by the Majeſty of the Emperour; which, next after God, was to be loved, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> L. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>5.</hi> Where he adds this remarkable reaſon for it; becauſe to him, when he hath remarkable the Name of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> faithful Devotion is to be performed, and all vigilant ſervice paid, <hi>as unto a preſent and corporeal God.</hi> The violation of which Oath, though made to an Heathen Prince, how heinouſly God takes; even as a deſpiſing of an Oath made to himſelf, and a breach of his own Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thoſe terrible threats do ſufficiently demonſtrate (<hi>XVII. Ezek. 12, 13, 14,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially v. <hi>19.20.</hi>) Which are denounced againſt <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who rebelled againſt the King of <hi>Babylon; who had made him ſwear by God, 2 Chron. XXXVI. 13.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were the firſt that we read of, who would not take this Oath of Allegiance: but (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, L. XVII. Antiq. Cap. <hi>3.</hi>) boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to be the moſt exact Obſervers of the Law of God, and therefore the moſt in his favour (while they were full of inward pride, arrogance and fraud) dared openly to oppoſe Kings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by their motions to raiſe War againſt them, and annoy them: refuſing, ſaith he, to take the Oath, when all the Jews had ſworn to be faithful to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Of this Sect, he adds, there were above ſix thouſand: who were ſo far from leſſening their crime by this refuſal, and making what they did againſt his Authority to be no Rebellion: that it heightned it very much, and was in it ſelf a piece of Rebellion: they having a natural Allegiance unto him, by being born his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome who from the beginning of this Verſe, argue this Book not to be <hi>Solomon</hi>'s: becauſe he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46873:80"/>ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I obſerve the mouth</hi> (i. e. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment) <hi>of the King.</hi> So they tranſlate the firſt words: which the LXX tranſlate as we do; and ſo do the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. For though the Hebrew word be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Ego I;</hi> it ſignifies nothing to this purpoſe; becauſe he doth not ſay <hi>I obſerve,</hi> but ſimply <hi>I; do thou</hi> obſerve. There being a diſtinctive Note between <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>I</hi> and what follows: ſhowing that it is a ſhort Form of Speech, to be ſupplied by ſome ſuch word as this, <hi>I ſay,</hi> or <hi>I command,</hi> or <hi>counſel;</hi> or rather <hi>charge</hi> thee. And the reaſon perhaps why the principal Verb was omitted, might be as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Primate of <hi>Ireland, Uſher,</hi> conjectures) becauſe no word could be found ſignificative enough to expreſs the deepneſs of the Charge.</p>
                     <p>Some may think that I have dilated too much upon this Verſe: but they may be pleaſed to conſider how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if not neceſſary it is, at this time, when men begin again to plead the lawfulneſs of reſiſtance. Which is ſo plainly condemned in this Place, that the moſt learned Aſſertors of the <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> were extremely puzzled to make it agree with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the late times of Rebellion. There is one who (in his Book called <hi>Natures Dowrie</hi> Chap. <hi>21.</hi>) calls in the aſſiſtance of a great many Hebrew Doctors to help him to another Tranſlation of the words; and yet after all is forced to acknowledge that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> is right enough: and is content to admit it, with this Proviſo, that <hi>the King manage well the affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> As much as to ſay, do what they would have him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> The firſt word in this Verſe is capable of ſeveral ſenſes, which I have endeavoured to expreſs in the Paraphraſe. For it originally ſignifies ſuch a paſſion and perturbation (particularly that of <hi>anger</hi>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:46873:80"/>and <hi>terror</hi>) as makes a man <hi>precipitant</hi> in his motions: being tranſlated ſometimes by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſometimes by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the LXX: And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wiſe man is, that in purſuance of the foregoing counſel (v. <hi>2.</hi>) we muſt take care, if we deſire to live happily, to ſuppreſs our paſſions; and not to ſhow the leaſt diſcontent with the Government: eſpecially not haſtily and raſhly to fling our ſelves (as we ſpeak) in a fume, out of the Kings preſence, on any occaſion: much leſs receive his Commands with impatience; or, which is worſt of all, incur his just diſpleaſure by ſullen diſobedience. For though we may think to eſcape the effects of it, we ſhall find our ſelves deceived: Princes having long arms (as the Phraſe is) to reach thoſe that offend them; though they flee never ſo far from them. This is the ſenſe of v. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And it is further enlarged in this Verſe: where <hi>Symmachus</hi> tranſlates the first words thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King is authoritative;</hi> carries ſuch authority with it, that it will be executed. For the word <hi>Shilton</hi> (from whence learned men have not unfitly derived the Titles of <hi>Sultan</hi> and <hi>Soldan</hi>) denotes ſuch a <hi>power</hi> as over-powers, and cannot be reſisted: like that of Death (v. <hi>8.</hi>) to which all must ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it follows, in the end of this Verſe, <hi>Who may ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?</hi> i. e. <hi>firſt,</hi> Who hath any authority to call him to an account? as much as to ſay, none hath, but God alone. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of an eminent <hi>Rabbi</hi> (quoted by the forenamed Primate in the entrance of his Book about <hi>Obedience</hi>) <hi>No Creature may judge the King, but the Holy and Bleſſed God alone.</hi> To allow the people (either collective, or repreſentative) to have power to do it, is to make them <hi>Accuſers,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46873:81"/>Judges</hi> and <hi>Executioners</hi> alſo, in their own cauſe; and that against their Sovereign. Nor <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Can any man ſafely attempt it; but he ſhall meet with puniſhment either here or hereafter. Which is no new Doctrine, but the ſame with that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> here honestly notes) <hi>they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation;</hi> which none ſhall be able to avoid. <hi>Therefore it is ſafeſt ſimply to obey Magiſtrates.</hi> Which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats again upon v. <hi>7. A man cannot do better than ſimply to obey.</hi> So Preachers, ſaith he, ſhould exhort the tumultuous and ſeditious. <hi>For judgment, vengeance, or puniſhment, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and decreed by God, to all the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: which none ſhall eſcape.</hi> And thus much the Author of <hi>Natures Dowry</hi> is forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the evident light he ſaw in this place; <hi>that the ſcope of the words is, that as we ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our own ſafety, we ought not to withſtand the Magiſtrate in his Edicts, which are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God.</hi> And it is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſaith he (out of <hi>Eliſha Gallico</hi> an Hebrew Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>in a private man, when the Magiſtrate enjoins what is repugnant to God's Will, to remove out of his Dominions, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with him.</hi> Which ſome conceive to be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word <hi>telec (go out, or go away)</hi> in the foregoing Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> From whence he again concludes it is the moſt prudent courſe, as well as moſt honeſt, to comply with thoſe that have authority over us, in a dutiful obedience, or humble ſubmiſſion. So I have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word <hi>Commandment,</hi> for the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King before mentioned. Which if we do not oppoſe, it is the way to preſerve us from <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrow;</hi> as we ſpeak, very agreeably to the Hebrew Phraſe in this place; if by <hi>evil thing</hi> we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46873:81"/>understand the evil of Puniſhment, rather than of ſin Many indeed by <hi>Commandment</hi> underſtand the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God; which if we keep we ſhall not fall into any Evil practices; particularly, not into Rebellion. Which is a good ſenſe, and the Reader may follow which he pleaſes: for the latter part of the Verſe will agree with either. Wherein he ſuggests that the wiſest thing we can do, when Princes require any thing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous unto us; is not to rebel; but, to watch the fitteſt opportunities to petition for redreſs: and that after ſuch a manner as may not give offence: So I have expounded <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> in this, and in the next Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> For the truth is, a great part of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our life, depends upon our diſcretion in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chuſing, the fittest opportunity for every thing, and the right manner of doing it.

                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> If the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reading would bear it, the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Tranſlation (which the <hi>Syriack</hi> follows) of this Verſe, hath given an excellent reaſon, why a man is at ſuch a loſs to diſcern what is fit for him to do upon all occaſions (eſpecially how to direct his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards Kings) <hi>Becauſe he knows little of what is paſt; and leſs, or rather nothing, of what is future.</hi> For Prudence conſiſts in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of things <hi>paſt,</hi> conſideration of things <hi>preſent,</hi> and foreſight of things likely to <hi>come</hi> hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> refers it wholly to the miſerable condition of a Rebell, in this manner, <q>He deſires various things and hopes for mighty matters by his diſobedience, but is lamentably deceived. For of the very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he promiſed himſelf, he cannot be ſecure; but in an hour when he thinks not of it, Judgment overtakes him and he periſhes in his diſobedience.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46873:82"/>In ſhort, the wicked contemns preſent obedience; and minds not future puniſhment. The Wiſe man acts quite otherways; and remembring what miſchiefs attend upon the rebellious, is ſtudious therefore to be obedient.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Hence he takes occaſion to give ſome good Advice to Princes themſelves (which ſeems to me the plainest ſenſe of this Verſe) not to abuſe their Power, becauſe none can withstand them, or ſo much as question them: but to remember how weak they are upon many accounts; and therefore ought to be moderate in their Government, if they intend to live happily. For otherwiſe they must expect their peoples hatred; which they cannot hinder, no more than they can Death, which is not in their power to reſist And if they be engaged in. War, they will find their Subjects aſſist them ſo coldly, that it may endanger the loſs of their Crown. So that Clauſe may be understood, which we tranſlate, <hi>there is</hi> no <hi>diſcharge in War</hi> (the word <hi>that</hi> being not in the Original) that is, it will be too late then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Subjects from the heavy burdens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have oppreſſed them; when they have need of their ſervice against an Enemy. Or, as I have expreſſed it in the Paraphraſe, they cannot command what ſucceſs they pleaſe in War; but the event will be dubious: taking the word <hi>Miſlachat</hi> for a <hi>Dart,</hi> a <hi>Javelin,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Weapon;</hi> which we cannot direct and guide in that confuſion, ſo as certainly to hit the Mark at which it is thrown. So the <hi>Targum</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Nor do the Inſtruments of Arms profit.</hi> Or we may take it for a <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to raiſe Forces (it being but once more uſed in the Bible, <hi>LXXVIII. Pſal. 49.</hi> and there the <hi>Miſlachat</hi> of evil Angels, ſeems to be a Company of Angels, ſent with a Commiſſion to do the Execution there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) which is too late to iſſue in the day of Battel, if
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46873:82"/>he be beaten: or, if he be not, yet let him not flatter himſelf (which is the ſenſe of the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe) as if he ſhould alway eſcape; for the Divine Justice will one day lay hold on him, and puniſh him.</p>
                     <p>Thus, with reference to Princes, the LXX ſeem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Verſe: who having ſaid v. <hi>4.</hi>

                        </gap>, but <hi>no man</hi> (no not the King himſelf) <hi>hath authority in all things; for example, not over the ſpirit of a man.</hi> But this Verſe alſo may be expounded (as ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters underſtand it) to be a continuance of the foregoing Diſcourſe; in this manner; that no man can bridle the wrath of the Prince (by <hi>ſpirit</hi> underſtanding <hi>anger</hi>) or hinder the irruption of it. And it is in vain alſo for men to ſeek to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Sentence of Death which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them: for if they ſhould wage War with him, it is not likely they would overcome or eſcape in the day of battle; or, if they did, they would meet ſome time or other with a juſt puniſhment for their Rebellion. Which is the meaning of the laſt Clauſe (if the words be thus taken) <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> that is, <hi>Rebellion</hi>) <hi>ſhall not deliver thoſe that are the Authors of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> This, and the following Verſe, agree very well with that Expoſition which refers v <hi>8.</hi> to Princes: who ſometimes are advanced to rule over others, to their <hi>own hurt.</hi> So we tranſlate the laſt words of this Verſe; which <hi>Luther</hi> (who is not alone in that Opinion) will have ſtill to belong to <hi>Subjects,</hi> over whom a Prince is ſometimes placed to be a Scourge unto them. Notwithſtanding which, ſaith he, the Kings Commandment is to be obſerved, and Sedition not to be moved. Which he repeats again (ſo full he was of this Doctrine) The Wiſe man here
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46873:83"/>grants that there may be evil Governours, to puniſh their Subjects; and yet theſe alſo are to be tolerated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> This Verſe I have taken wholly to belong to <hi>wicked Rulers;</hi> becauſe all the ancient Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do ſo, as well as our Engliſh. Though moſt of the modern Interpreters will have the firſt part of the Verſe to refer unto wicked Governours, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part unto good; whoſe memory is aboliſhed, when the other (ſo bad is mankind) are extolled and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured: For which I ſee no reaſon, but look upon it as contrary to the deſign of the Wiſe man, in this place; and therefore I have rejected it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The place of the Holy]</hi> may be expounded divers ways; but it ſeems to me moſt natural, to take it for a Periphraſe of the Place of Judgment (mentioned <hi>III. 16.</hi>) in which the Judges ſuſtained the Perſon of God: who was in their Aſſembly, and judged in the midſt of them, <hi>LXXXI. Pſal. 1.</hi> Whence the Judgment-Seat was called the <hi>place of the holy,</hi> i. e. of God the <hi>Holy one</hi> of Iſrael: whom the Jews now conſtantly call by the Name of <hi>the Holy, that moſt Bleſſed one.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> underſtands it of the <hi>Temple</hi> (but then it muſt be tranſlated, not the <hi>place of the holy,</hi> but the <hi>holy place,</hi> which is not agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) and expounds the words thus, <hi>The wicked buried, who were eſteemed Saints in the Earth; and while they lived were thought worthy, Princes in the Church, and in the Temple of God.</hi> I have ſometimes thought that the words might, according to this ſenſe of the <hi>holy place,</hi> be thus word for word rendred out of the Hebrew (if the Grammarians will permit <hi>Holy</hi> here not to be a Subſtantive) <hi>I ſaw the wicked buried, and they</hi> (that is, ſuch as attended their Funeral) <hi>came, and even out of the holy place followed.</hi> That is, the very Prieſts waited on the Herſe, to do them the greater honour.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46873:83"/>Or thus, <hi>The Funeral Pomp reached from the very Temple, to the Place of Burial.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> From hence he takes occaſion to ſhow what is the very root of mens malicious and incurable wickedneſs. And the <hi>firſt</hi> thing to which he aſcribes it is, their thriving a long time in evil courſes; which makes them hope this proſperity will continue to the end of their days. And if they can but live ſplendidly; they care not what becomes of them when they die. Now though there be a <hi>pithgam</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> a <hi>definitive Sentence</hi> (as the word ſignifies) paſſed againſt them; yet nothing being done upon it, ſo ſoon as we expect; it both hardens the heart of thoſe Sinners, and mightily diſcourages better men: who hereupon grow angry, or flag in their Duty: to both which <hi>Luther</hi> would have what follows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                     <p>But it properly belongs to the Evil-doers, who upon the ſuſpence of the Judgment paſſed upon them, ſin on with great confidence; and have nothing elſe in their thoughts but malicious contrivances. Both which may be denoted by this Phraſe, <hi>their heart is filled in them</hi> to do evil.</p>

                        <hi>[m] V. 12, 13.]</hi> Yet this is not to be understood, he here ſhows, without exception; but ſometimes the Divine Juſtice proceeds to quick execution. Which is a thing noted by Heathens themſelves, that God cuts Tyrants ſhort; and ſuffers them not to ravage ſo long, as they hope to do. And thence they exhort them to moderation; according to that of <hi>Steſichorus,</hi> quoted by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Rhetoricks</hi> (as <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> here obſerves) <hi>Do not injure any man, for the very Graſhoppers will chirp it in the Fields.</hi> That is, the Poor, who are oppreſſed, ſend out their Complaints, and move God to puniſh ſuch Tyrants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 14.]</hi> Here he diſcovers the other root of mens
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46873:84"/>incurable wickedneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the examples they ſee of, thoſe who live vertuouſly, and yet live miſerably. Which proves a great ſcandal to thoſe who admire worldly things too much: and makes them angry, at least, to behold how all was given heretofore, for instance, to wicked Prieſts, and now godly ones have ſcarce bread to put into their mouths. They are the words of <hi>Luther,</hi> who obſerves that Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have better Pay, than many of Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; who are to lead his People, and conduct them unto Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 15.]</hi> Notwithstanding which, the Wiſe man adviſes him that would live as happily, as the state of things here will permit, not to grow ſullen at this (v. <hi>15.</hi>) much leſs to doubt of God's good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; nor to be disturbed, though we are not able to give a reaſon, why vertuous men ſuffer very much, when the wicked at the ſame time eſcape. Which I take to be the meaning of the <hi>two laſt Verſes;</hi> which I have referred to our ignorance of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matter; as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo doth, whoſe words are theſe: <hi>He that ſeeks the cauſes, and reaſons of things, why this or that is done, and why the World is governed by various events; why one man is blind and lame, and another is born with eyes and ſound; one is poor, and another is rich; this man is noble, that inglorious; he gets nothing by his enquiry but only this, to be tormented in his own Queſtions, and to have his Diſputations inſtead of a Rack; and yet not find what he ſought.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That word in the Hebrew which we tranſlate <hi>becauſe though,</hi> is found only in this place; but from the <hi>I.

                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.</hi> Though <hi>Solomon</hi> had often, and thoroughly conſidered that Queſtion, mentioned in the Argument of this Chapter; yet he could come to no reſolution about it, but this: That it ought not to ſhake our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of God's love to vertuous men (which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46873:88"/>in that Phraſe, <hi>in the hand of God;</hi> wherein are included all the effects of his kindneſs and care) and that we muſt not judge men to be good or bad, by what befals them in their outward eſtates. So thoſe words are moſt naturally interpreted, <hi>A man knoweth not love or hatred, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed refer unto men, not unto God, in this ſenſe: <hi>No man knows certainly what is beſt for him, in this World;</hi> and conſequently cannot tell what he ſhould deſire, and what deprecate, of all the things that are before him. For thoſe things, which he hates and is averſe unto, may be as good for him as thoſe which he loves, and wiſhes to enjoy. To this purpoſe <hi>Maldonate.</hi> Or thus, No man knows whether that which he loves, or that which he hates ſhall befal him; but <hi>all things are before them:</hi> that is are appointed how they ſhall be, antecedent to the will of men. Thus <hi>Eben Ezra.</hi> And there are thoſe who interpret that Phraſe <hi>before them,</hi> in this manner: <hi>They ſee the good and evil which befals them, but cannot foreſee it till it come upon them.</hi> And ſome joyn both together thus, <hi>Neither the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nor disfavour of men, neither their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or oppoſing what we do, is any certain mark that we are good or bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I have followed that ſenſe which ſeemed to me moſt ſimple and moſt coherent with the reſt of the words. As for that Doctrine which many great Writers in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have built upon this Text, that <hi>no man can be certain whether he be in the favour of God or no, while he is in this life; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> truly calls it, <hi>Interpretatio Monachorum;</hi> the Interpretation of the Monks; who diſtorted the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and wreathed them to their own dotages. For it is madneſs, ſaith he in another place (in his Treatiſe of Good Works) to ſay, that we know not whether Murderers and Adulterers are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God's hatred,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:46873:89"/>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> For this next Verſe plainly ſhows, that he ſpeaks of ſuch notes of God's favour or hatred, as men are very deſirous he would make; by putting a difference between good and bad men, in external things. Which he is not pleaſed to do; but they are ſick, or loſe their Goods, their Children or Friends, all alike. Which is more particularly true in publick calamities as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> excellently diſcourſes, both in his Book to <hi>Demetrian,</hi> and in his Book <hi>de Mortalitate.</hi> In the former of which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that good and bad men being in this World, as in one and the ſame houſe; whatſoever befals the houſe muſt neceſſarily befal the Inhabitants; who cannot be well, when the common Air wherein they all breathe is infected; nor have a good Crop, when there wants Rain to make the Earth fruitful. "Only herein (ſaith he to the Pagans) <q>we are not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares &amp; aequales vobis,</hi> alike and undiſtinguiſh'd from you: that we do not grieve as you do, in theſe common calamities; we are not ſo impatient; nor make ſuch outcries, and complaints: but a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and religious patience quiets our mind, and makes us thankful to God. <hi>Viget apud nos ſpei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>robur,</hi> &amp;c. the ſtrength of Faith is vigorous among us; and the firmneſs of hope: and a mind erect in the midſt of the ruines of a decaying World: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an immoveable Vertue; a conſtantly joyful patience; and a Soul always ſecure of her God. So that ſhe may ſay with the Prophet <hi>(III. Habakk. 17, 18.) Although the fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither ſhould fruit be in the vine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difference of the ſeveral expreſſions uſed here in this Verſe, for good men and bad, I have explained, as well as I could, in the Paraphraſe. And they that would ſee Examples of the ſame event to every one
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46873:89"/>of the oppoſite perſons, may look into the Hebrew Commentators, or into <hi>Mercer,</hi> and there find them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> In this and the following Verſes, he ſhows the ill uſe men make of the foregoing Obſervation; and their folly therein. For, imagining God loves all men alike, becauſe they find the ſame things happen to them all, they run into ſuch an exceſs of wickedneſs, with ſuch a frantick liberty, as brings them ſpeedily to their Graves: whereby they loſe what they would have kept, and what they deſired and hoped ſtill to get. Thus I have interpreted v. <hi>4.</hi> in which there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great difficulty; both becauſe of the various reading of one word, which we tranſlate <hi>joyned to;</hi> and the uncertainty whether <hi>Solomon</hi> here deliver his own Opinion or the Opinion of the <hi>Epicures:</hi> whom ſome think he here introduces, and making a Speech which reaches to v. <hi>11.</hi> which is the ſenſe of <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> among the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and of ſeveral <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, who herein follow ſome of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:</hi> whoſe Wiſe men ſay (as we read in <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> his <hi>More Nevochim,</hi> part. II. Cap. <hi>28.</hi>) <hi>that ſome ſought to ſmother the Book of</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes, <hi>becauſe its words ſavour of Hereſie.</hi> From which imputation that they might free it, they took ſuch words as they thought lookt that way, to be the Sayings of carnal men. But there is no need to have recourſe to this way of Expoſition (as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> acknowledges) which I have not followed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there ſeems to me to be an eaſie and plain ſenſe of the words, in coherence with the foregoing. And in the expreſſing of that ſenſe I have neglected neither the <hi>Writing,</hi> nor the <hi>Reading,</hi> as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Hebrews ſpeak: but taken notice of the ſenſe of the word we tranſlate <hi>joyned to,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Text,</hi> and as it is in the <hi>Margin</hi> of the Hebrew Bibles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:46873:90"/>
There are many other ways of explaining it, and the whole Verſe; but I ſhall not trouble the Reader with any of them, ſave only with <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s (which I do not find taken notice of by any of the latter Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters) who tranſlates the words thus: <hi>What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be choſen? in one that is alive there is hope; and a living Dog,</hi> &amp;c. In anſwer, ſaith he, to thoſe who being diſturbed at the confuſion of things, asked, <hi>Muſt we then chuſe to labour, when we meet with no rewards? Solomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, By all means follow your Calling, and commend events to God: <q>there is hope while a man lives that he may come to ſomething; and although thou canſt not be a Lion, yet be content to be a meaner Creature, though it be but a little Dog. Thou art not able to be ſuch a Captain as <hi>Scipio;</hi> yet thou mayſt be like to <hi>Fabius.</hi> Why do we ſeek for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſuch Heroical Captains, and Governours, a <hi>Gideon, Samſon,</hi> and <hi>David?</hi> Let us uſe ſuch as we have, who though they be not like thoſe Lions, yet may be like ſmall Dogs. And let them do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their places; and pray to God they may be Veſſels of mercy. In which conſideration, ſaith he, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtays long; ſaying in the following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the dead are gone from the Government of this World; and therefore we muſt uſe thoſe that are preſent, follow our Calling, reſt in God by Faith and a good Conſcience, whatſoever the events be.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for thoſe that fanſie the Wiſe man would here contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf in what he ſaid Chap. IV. <hi>2, 3.</hi> unleſs we take theſe words for the Opinion of other men, they may be eaſily anſwered; that both are true in different reſpects. There he ſpeaks with reſpect to the <hi>troubles</hi> of life; and here with reſpect to the <hi>advantages</hi> of it: The chief of which is, hope of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our condition, when it is never ſo miſerable.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46873:90"/>Which may be extended to the mind, as well as our outward concerns: there is hope men may live to ſee their follies, correct their miſtakes, amend their lives, and recover the favour of God: which is irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loſt when they are gone from hence. In ſhort, he ſeems to ſay the ſame that the Heathen meant, in the Fable of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box: in which <hi>Hope</hi> alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, after every thing elſe that was good, was flown away. And there are the like Sayings in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> and <hi>Euripides:</hi> which may be found in <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>'s <hi>Adages,</hi> Chil. <hi>2.</hi> Cent. <hi>4.</hi> Adag. <hi>12.</hi>

                        <hi>[d]</hi> There is little difficulty in the following Verſes; where there are ſeveral paſſages which ſhow, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is not repreſenting the ſenſe of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing after this life; but hath reſpect only to the ſtate of men here in this World, as he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the concluſion of v. <hi>6.</hi> And in the Seventh verſe plainly ſuppoſes the man to whom he directs his Diſcourſe to be religiouſly affected, and to govern himſelf in his pleaſures, with a regard to God, and the cenſure that He will paſs upon his actions in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: and thereupon adviſes him to a cheerful uſe of all manner of good things in this life.</p>

By which Advice he reproves that old Saying, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber quiſque Fortunae ſuae; Every man makes his own Fortune:</hi> "Which (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſpeaks in a Diſcourſe, <hi>touching helps to the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Powers:</hi> 
                        <q>we ought to look upon as an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and unlucky Saying: except it be uttered as an hortative or ſpur to correct ſloth; and (I may add) to excite us to watchfulneſs, in laying hold-of all opportunities, and neglecting no occaſions of doing our ſelves good.</q> 
                        <q>For otherwiſe, if it be believed as it ſounds, and a man enters into an high imagination that he can compaſs and fathom all accidents, and aſcribes all ſucceſſes to his own drift and reaches, and the contrary to his errours and ſleepings, it is a prophane Speech, and it is commonly ſeen that the Evening-Fortune of that man is not ſo proſperous, as of him that, without ſlacking his induſtry, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth much to Felicity and Providence above him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet this is not the ſame Doctrine with that neither, which ſaith, <hi>Vitam Fortuna regit, non Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> Fortune, not Wiſdom, governs the life of man. For, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> obſerves upon the concluſion of this Book, there is much difference between <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Sayings. The <hi>Church,</hi> in ſuch Sayings as this, confirms Providence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us to have God in our thoughts; whether events be anſwerable to our deſires, or not. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Writers, in ſuch Sayings as that now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leave out Divine Providence, and take no notice of it; but only of a blind Power, which troubles all things that are wiſely deſigned.</p>
                     <p>It is no impertinent inference which <hi>Corranus</hi> makes from theſe words, That all the things which the <hi>ſwift,</hi> the <hi>valiant,</hi> and the reſt of the perſons here mentioned
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46873:92"/>ſeek, being their end, of which they frequently miſs; it is an Argument that the happineſs of man conſiſts not either in <hi>Fame,</hi> or <hi>Victory,</hi> or <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> or <hi>riches,</hi> or the <hi>favour</hi> of others; but in contentment with ſuch things as we have, and God ſhall think good for us, in his wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 12.]</hi> Which hath given us many Examples of men, who incited by falſe perſwaſions, and fooliſh hopes, dreamt of good events; when in the midſt of their courſe, they were oppreſſed with great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> gloſſes upon theſe words in ver. <hi>12.</hi> and inſtances in <hi>Marius, Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> Which he explains more largely, in his <hi>Review</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> Chapter of this Book, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he died. <q>Where he obſerves how <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> were diſappointed when they hoped for Victory in a good Cauſe: and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> when they hoped by the treacherous ſlaughter of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to have reſtored the Form of the old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick: and <hi>Antony,</hi> when he thought by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to make himſelf Monarch of the World.

                           </gap>. Vain men are abuſed by their own deſires, which lead them to make falſe accounts, and fills them with vain expectations. And it teaches us the truth of thoſe Divine Sayings, <hi>The way of man is not in himſelf. Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it,</hi> &amp;c. Examples of which we have in <hi>Saul,</hi> who hoped to have left the Kingdom to his Poſteritys and in <hi>David</hi> himſelf, who thought once of having <hi>Abſolom</hi> for his Succeſſor. But <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here teaches us to conſider, how infinitely the wiſe Providence of God excels our greateſt wit and cunning, and can more eaſily over-reach all our

                        <hi>[k] V. 13,</hi> &amp;c.] Which ſhould not diſcourage wiſe and regular Proceedings; but only make us refer our ſelves unto God: who, as He thus diſappoints the moſt probable hopes, ſo, at other times makes men ſucceſsful, when they have no hope at all. As <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſhows in the following Obſervation, v. <hi>13, 14.</hi> Upon which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> gloſſes in this manner: <q>It hath been often ſeen, that a ſmall City and few Inhabitants, being beſet by an Army of innumerable Enemies, and beſieged ſo ſtraitly, that they were in danger, if not otherways, to periſh by Famine; were, on a ſudden, contrary to all mens-expectation, delivered by a mean perſon, who having more Wiſdom than all the wealthy, great, powerful and proud Citizens, thought of a way to ſave them, when they gave themſelves for loſt; and effected that alſo, of which they utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired. And yet, O the ungrateful forgetfulneſs of Mankind! after the Seige was raiſed, after the liberty of their Country was reſtored, there was no body thought of this poor man, no body gave him thanks for their ſafety: but all honoured the rich, who in their danger could do them no ſervice.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 15.]</hi> Which ſets forth, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon this Verſe (L. <hi>8. de Aug. Scient.</hi> C. <hi>2.</hi> Parab. <hi>21.</hi>) <q>the depraved and malignant Nature of Mankind. Who in extremities and ſtraits, commonly flee to men of wiſdom and courage; whom before they deſpiſed: but ſo ſoon as the Storm is over, they become unthankful Wretches to their Preſervers. <hi>Machiavel,</hi> not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, propounds the Queſtion, Whether ſhould be moſt grateful to well-deſerving perſons, the Prince or the People? but in the mean time he taxeth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46873:93"/>them both of ingratitude. Though this doth not ariſe merely from the ingratitude of the Prince, or the people alone; but there is added too oft to this the envy of the Nobility: who in ſecret repine at the event, though happy and proſperous, becauſe it proceeded not from themſelves. For which cauſe they extenuate the merit of the act, and depreſs the Author.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was ſerved (as <hi>Luther</hi> here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) who having performed great things for his Citizens, was baſely requited by them. Nay, <hi>David</hi> himſelf was ſoon forgotten, who had been the greateſt Benefactor to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ten of whoſe Tribes ſoon renounced all dependance on his houſe, and fell off quite from their ſubjection to it. So that to do good to the World, ſaith he, is to throw away the benefits we beſtow; or to caſt Gold into Dung, and Pearls before Swine. And therefore it is beſt to enjoy what we have, and to mind our preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; caſting away care of the future. For as <hi>Phaedria</hi> ſaith in <hi>Terence, It is better my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſhould be loſt, than I ſhould be loſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them.</hi> And not to be moved from our Duty by the Worlds ingratitude, is an Advice he oft repeats, very profitably, in this Chapter: that we may be like to our heavenly Father, who doth good to the evil and to the unthankful.</p>

So most Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46873:98"/>understand the latter part of the Verſe; which <hi>Melancthon,</hi> following the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets quite contrary; that <hi>a little folly,</hi> or rather <hi>folly for a little while, is better than Wiſdom and Glory:</hi> That is, ſeeming folly, like that of <hi>Fabius,</hi> who was condemned for his ſlow proceedings, and thought a cowardly Fool; is better than Wiſdom which makes a glorious ſhow, but doth not conduct things ſo ſafely as that Captain did.</p>
                     <p>But this Expoſition agrees not at all with the Similitude, whereby <hi>Solomon</hi> illuſtrates what he here ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Folly. Which is that of <hi>dead,</hi> or rather <hi>venomous Flies</hi> (for the Hebrew Phraſe <hi>Flies of death</hi> may better be tranſlated <hi>deadly,</hi> than <hi>dead</hi> Flies) which though very little Animals, yet falling into a Pot of precious Ointment, ſpoil it all when they putrefie: and not only take away the delicate ſcent, but turn it into a filthy, noiſome stink. For a Fly is obſerved to be both <hi>foedum &amp; foetidum Animalculum;</hi> eſpecially ſome ſort of them, which ſeem here to be particularly denoted by the Word <hi>Zebube:</hi> being not merely bred out of filth, and delighting to live in it, but leaving behind them ſuch a humour as is very offenſive to the ſmell, and kills thoſe Creatures into whom they thrust their ſnouts. From whence the God of the <hi>Ekronites</hi> had his Name of <hi>Baal zebub (2 Kings I. 2.)</hi> which if it were given him by his Worſhippers, ſignified his power to deſtroy thoſe venomous Flies which infeſted the Inhabitants of that Country: if by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> expreſſed their contempt of him, as a mean, and a filthy, ſordid Idol. For therefore St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> compares the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to a <hi>Flie, VII. 18.</hi> not only becauſe they were a weak people, but <hi>propter ſordes Idololatriae,</hi> by reaſon of the ſordid filthineſs of their Idolatry: which was a great reproach to their famed Wiſdom: and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46873:98"/>made them vile, even in the opinion of Pagan people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> cannot here omit the reflection, which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made upon theſe words (L. VIII. <hi>de Augment. Scient.</hi> C. <hi>2.</hi> Parab. <hi>11.</hi>) <q>that the caſe of men eminent for Vertue, is very hard, and miſerable; becauſe their errours, though never ſo ſmall, are by no means pardoned. But as in a pure Diamond, of great luſtre, the very leaſt ſpeck or ſmalleſt cloud ſtrikes the eye, and affects it with a kind of trouble; which in a groſſer Stone would ſcarce be obſerved: ſo in men of ſingular abilities, the leaſt infirmities are preſently eſpied, and become the matter of mens diſcourſe, and are perſtringed with a heavier cenſure; which in men of meaner parts or rank would either paſs without notice, or eaſily procure pardon. <hi>Therefore a little folly in a very wiſe man, a ſmall ſin in a very honeſt man, and a ſlight indecency of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a man of courtly and elegant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, much derogates from their fame and reputation.</hi> So that it would not be the worst courſe for excellent perſons, <hi>if they would min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſome abſurdities</hi> (ſo it may be done without guilt) <hi>with their actions:</hi> that they may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a kind of liberty to themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Notes and Characters of ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> From hence <hi>Solomon</hi> takes occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent more largely, how much men ſuffer by their folly, and what advantages Wiſdom gives them: and treats of both, with reſpect, not only to mens private, but to the publick good. And <hi>firſt</hi> he ſhows what a difference there is between a wiſe man and a Fool, in the management of any buſineſs. So I have interpreted this Verſe, which may be alſo thus paraphraſed, <hi>A Wiſe man always takes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46873:99"/>honeſt courſes; but a Fool turns into bye ways.</hi> Thus <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> gloſſes; <hi>A Wiſe man is his own Leader and Conducter to the beſt things; but a Fool inclines to the wrong ſide, nor will his folly ever lead him to any thing that is excellent.</hi> Which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> expreſſes in this manner; <hi>A Wiſe man always thinks of the World to come, which leads to the right hand; but he that is a Fool, only of the preſent World, which lies on the left.</hi> And quotes a famous Paſſage of <hi>Lactantius</hi> (which I find in his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> L. VI. Cap. <hi>2.</hi>) concerning the Letter <hi>Y,</hi> unto which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> reſembled the courſe of humane life. In which there is a time, when a Youth finds his way cleft, as that Letter is; into two parts or ways; and he ſtands doubting unto which he ſhould incline. If he be ſo wiſe as to take the right hand way, he is happy; if the other, he is miſerable. Which ſenſe <hi>Grotius</hi> follows; <hi>the right hand is the way of Vertue; the left, the way of Vice.</hi> Unto which we may reduce that of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt, The heart of the wiſe inclines to the Law of God, which was given from God's right hand; the Fool to Silver and Gold, which are the gifts of the left.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if this had been the ſenſe, it would have been more proper to have ſaid, the Wiſe mans heart is on <hi>the right hand;</hi> not on <hi>his</hi> right hand; which is much different: and therefore I have omitted this in the Paraphraſe (though I thought good to mention it here) and taken no notice of many other Gloſſes; particularly that of <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s, which ſeems ſomething nearer to the ſenſe: <hi>The wiſe man hath power over his affections</hi> (the right hand being the ſtrongeſt, and the inſtrument of action in most men) <hi>and can moderate them, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46873:99"/>but a Fool is under the Government of his paſſions; and is hurried that way, which his anger, ambition, grief, and other blind affections drive him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will add this that the meaning may be: <hi>A Wiſe man hath his Wiſdom always at hand;</hi> to direct him what to do, in publick or in private buſineſs; whether he have to do with Friends or Enemies; in adverſity, as well as in a proſperous eſtate (his mind being juſt like the right hand, which we uſe readily, upon all occaſions, for all manner of actions) <hi>but a Fool is to ſeek;</hi> and knows not which way to turn himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is much to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with what I have ſaid in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> And agrees with what follows, in this Verſe, the firſt Words of which ſignifie as much as, <hi>Moreover,</hi> a Fool is ſo ſilly, that he cannot hide it. For though the reſt of the Diſeaſes of the mind may be covered by artificial Diſcourſe, as the blemiſhes of our Bodies are with our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; only folly cannot be diſſembled, but will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all, in every motion of him whoſe weakneſs it is.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſenſe of the laſt Words of the Verſe, beſide that in our Tranſlation; which I have not neglected: becauſe the Words will bear the ſenſe of the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> viz. <hi>He ſaith every Body is a Fool.</hi> Which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> interprets thus, <hi>He judges all men by himſelf. Symmachus</hi> thus, <hi>He fanſies himſelf the only Wiſe man.</hi> The LXX (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves) ſeem wide from the ſenſe, who tranſlate it thus: <hi>All that he thinks is very vain. Maldonate</hi> underſtands it differently from them all, in this manner: <hi>In that wherein he himſelf offends, he reprehends others.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And then <hi>Solomon</hi> proceeds to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance of this Folly and Wiſdom; eſpecially
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46873:100"/>in the Publick State and Government. Where it is great folly for a Governour to carry himſelf haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and furiouſly; but if he do, it is no leſs folly in his people to oppoſe him with the like paſſions; and not rather to be patient and peaceable: which is the ſenſe of v. <hi>4.</hi> Which ſome take for a Counſel to Governours; others to the Subject. They that underſtand it as Counſel to Governours, tranſlate it ſome of theſe ways: <hi>If the ſpirit of a Governour come upon thee,</hi> that is, if thou art fitted for Government, and advanced unto Dignity, behave thy ſelf humbly; and adminiſter all things with great lenity: for that is the beſt way, to heal pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſtempers. Or thus, <hi>If thou art made a Prince, diſcharge this Office diligently,</hi> and with vigilance: for if thou art remiſs and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it will make thee fall into great errours. Or, as ſome will have it, in this manner, <hi>Thou haſt a deſire to be in authority, ſuppreſs it;</hi> or if it be offered thee, accept not of it: a private life is better; and leſs ſubject to the occaſions of ſin and danger. And ſome tranſlate it thus, <hi>If thou art in ſingular favour with the Governour, keep thy ſtation notwithſtanding; and be not ambitious of Preferment,</hi> &amp;c. Which is Counſel unto Subjects; and by <hi>ruach (ſpirit)</hi> of the Ruler, moſt do not underſtand his <hi>favour,</hi> but his <hi>anger:</hi> and then alſo it may be taken in a different ſenſe from that in our Tranſlation (making it ſtill an Advice to him that is in Authority) that if anger come upon him, he ſhould reflect, and conſider the ſtation wherein he is; leſt this paſſion make him act undecently, and tranſport him into great ſins.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt part of Interpreters, taking the Verſe to be Counſel to a Subject, in caſe he incur the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Prince, I have followed that ſenſe; which is almoſt agreeable to the coherence. And I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46873:100"/>have interpreted that Advice, <hi>not to leave his place,</hi> as moſt do, for not quitting the Duty of a Subject: but have taken in alſo the moſt ingenious Interpretation of the Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi> Who makes this a Political Advice to Courtiers; not to relinquiſh their Place and Office, nor to retire from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Charge, as many do when they ſee their Prince angry with them. <q>Which ariſes part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of an <hi>impatience of diſgrace;</hi> partly leſt they ſhould <hi>make the wound bleed afreſh,</hi> by coming into the preſence; partly that their Prince may ſee <hi>how ſorrowful, and humble</hi> they are: which makes them think fit to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their employments; nay, to reſign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Offices and Dignities themſelves into the Princes hands.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But <hi>Solomon</hi> diſallows this way of Cure, as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prejudicial; and that upon very good grounds. For <hi>firſt</hi> this courſe, doth <hi>too much publiſh the diſgrace it ſelf:</hi> from whence both Enemies and Enviers grow more bold to hurt; and Friends more timorous to help. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By this means it comes to paſs, that <hi>the wrath of the Prince,</hi> which, if it had not been made publick, would have died perhaps of it ſelf, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes now more fixt:</hi> and having begun to overthrow the man, is carried on to his utter ruine. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> this retiring <hi>ſavours ſomething of a malignant humour;</hi> that is fallen out with the times: which heaps the miſchief of indignation, upon the miſchief of ſuſpicion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The proper Precepts therefore for a Cure, are theſe; which he thinks are contained in the laſt Words, <hi>Pliant demeanour pacifies great offences. Firſt,</hi> Above all things <hi>not to ſeem inſenſible or not ſo affected, as in Duty he ought to be; for the Princes diſpleaſure;</hi> either through
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46873:101"/>
                           <hi>ſtupidity</hi> or a <hi>ſtubbornneſs,</hi> and pride of ſpirit. That is, Let his countenance be compoſed, not to a ſullen and contumacious, but to a grave and modeſt penſiveneſs; and in all manner of employments, let him ſhow himſelf leſs pleaſant and cheerful than he was wont to be. Which, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient alſo that, ſome Friend or other ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Prince; and inſinuate ſeaſonably, with what ſenſible grief he is inwardly afflicted. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Let him carefully avoid all, even the leaſt occaſions,</hi> whereby either the thing it ſelf, which was the firſt cauſe of the indignation may be revived; or the Prince apprehend a new occaſion to be diſpleaſed with him again, or, upon any account whatſoever, to chide him before others. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let him with all diligence ſeek, on the other ſide, all manner of occaſions, wherein <hi>his ſervice may be acceptable to his Prince;</hi> that both he may ſhow a prompt and forward affection to redeem his forepaſt offence; and his Prince may understand, what a good Servant he is likely to loſe, if he thus cast him off. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Let him ſagaciouſly either <hi>lay the fault upon others;</hi> or inſinuate, that <hi>it was committed with no ill intention,</hi> in himſelf; or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <hi>their malice</hi> who accuſed him to the King, or aggravated his fault, more than it deſerved.

                     <p>There is another Great Man, of our own, who ſeems to take this for an Admonition, not to be falſe-hearted, by flinching from our station, when mighty men frown upon us. <hi>In an upright courſe</hi> (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> in his Sermon upon <hi>1. Cor. VII. 24.</hi> Sect. <hi>46.</hi>) <hi>Fear not the face of man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave thy place, though the ſpirit of a Ruler riſe up againſt thee: patience will conjure
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46873:101"/>down again that Spirit in time, only if thou keep thy ſelf within thy Circle.</hi> But I look upon this, which agrees not with the latter part of the Verſe, as an accommodation only of theſe Words to his preſent purpoſe; and not as intended for the proper ſenſe of them.</p>

                        <hi>[e]</hi> But of all other follies, this is the moſt miſchievous, of which Princes themſelves are ſometimes guilty: in preferring (as it follows v. <hi>6, 7.</hi>) unworthy men (who are ſo unfit to govern others, that they cannot govern themſelves) to the higheſt Dignities, and perhaps truſts: and at the ſame time neglecting, if not depreſſing men of worth and honour, of Noble Families, and ſometime of Heroical Vertue. Which is more provoking, becauſe more pernicious, than the perſonal diſpleaſure (before mentioned v. <hi>4.</hi>) which they expreſs towards any private man. For it is an univerſal grievance, and as if the Ruler himſelf ſhould give order for all the miſchief which they do (as ſome expound that Phraſe <hi>as an errour</hi>) And yet notwithſtanding, it is the wiſeſt courſe not to be exaſperated by it, to make any tumults and ſeditions; but to be patient and quiet, v. <hi>8.9.</hi> So I have expounded theſe Verſes, in connection one with another: for though there are thoſe who by <hi>Ruler</hi> here underſtand the <hi>Devil;</hi> who thrusts the worſt men into the beſt Places (as may be ſeen in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Commentaries) and others underſtand <hi>God</hi> who permits this; yet the whole Diſcourſe is ſtill to the ſame purpoſe. that ſenſeleſs perſons get into power; being more acceptable many times at Court (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> gloſſes) than the wiſe and good.

For to <hi>ride</hi> belonged unto Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: as to go on foot, unto Inferiors.

                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Yet it is as ſenſeleſs, to be inraged, by this preferment of ſenſeleſs and unworthy men, into rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the Wiſe man here ſhows by ſeveral Proverbial Sayings. In the Application of which to this purpoſe, I have the approbation of <hi>Melancthon:</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the last Words of v. <hi>8.</hi> and the first of v. <hi>9.</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:46873:102"/>concerning the puniſhment of thoſe; who go about to change the ancient Laws, and the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is more agreeable to the Phraſes of <hi>breaking hedges,</hi> and <hi>removing land-marks,</hi> or ſuch like things; than to apply it unto the miſchiefs that Princes bring upon themſelves and their Countries, by ſuch imprudent promotions, as are before-mentioned: though that be true alſo; that ſuch diſorders give great diſgust, and are the occaſion of dangerous commotions. Which commonly are moſt fatal, notwithſtanding, to thoſe that are ſo fooliſh as to adviſe, contrive, and excite them. Who bring that miſchief on themſelves which they intended ſhould wholly have fallen upon others; as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſhows by two Similitudes.

Agreeable to that old Saying which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> mentions (in his <hi>third</hi> Book of <hi>Rhetoricks,</hi> Cap. <hi>9.</hi> out of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus Chius</hi>

Deut. 15.</hi> There were Water-Serpents alſo, <hi>IX. Amos 3.</hi> of which men were in leſs danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> There is great variety of judgments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of this Verſe: But that which I have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46873:103"/>given I am ſure is not improper; which in ſhort is this: That they who out of love with novelty will not let things alone in their place, but be altering and changing, though thereby they make great rents and diſtractions; do not only give themſelves a great deal of trouble, and diſturb the quiet of their own mind; but run the hazard of ruining themſelves, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with whole Kingdoms and Churches. Therefore that Saying of <hi>Pindar,</hi> quoted by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> ſhould alway be in peoples minds: <hi>It is eaſie to diſturb a Government; but God alone can ſettle it again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Phraſes are ſufficiently explained in the Paraphraſe: only I think fit to note that the Word which, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>LXX,</hi> we tranſlate <hi>endangered,</hi> is by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterus</hi> tranſlated <hi>aſpergetur,</hi> that is, hurt by the <hi>ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> There is no leſs variety, but rather greater, in the interpretation of this Verſe: Wherein he ſeems to return to the commendation of Wiſdom. And it may ſtill refer to what went immediately before; as I have applied it, in the latter end of my Paraphraſe. In which I have not varied from our Tranſlation; if after thoſe Words <hi>put to more ſtrength,</hi> theſe be underſtood; <hi>but all in vain:</hi> And ſo the Words may be tranſlated out of the Hebrew, <hi>If the iron be blunt, and he</hi> (that cutteth with it) <hi>do not whet the edge; it will overcome all the force he uſes:</hi> that is, will not cut as he would have it. And ſo the meaning of the Verſe is excellently expreſſed by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (in his Preface to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning) Theſe words,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>inſinuate, that a wiſe election of the means, doth more efficaciouſly conduce unto the accompliſhment of any enterprize; than any inforcement or accumulation of endeavours.</hi> For as the Saying is, <hi>Claudus in via antevertit Curſorem extra viam.</hi> A lame man in the way, will outrum a Poſt out of the way.</p>

                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:46873:103"/>
But though I take this to be the true ſenſe; yet I ſhall here mention ſome others, that the Reader may chuſe which he thinks moſt congruous. Some take that Word <hi>chajalim,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>ſtrength,</hi> for <hi>Forces</hi> or <hi>Armies;</hi> and make the ſenſe this; <hi>Where an Army is governed by Wiſdom, it prevails though it be defective in Weapons: For Wiſdom doth more to ſet things right</hi> (i. e. doth more to make up the want of Arms) <hi>than Arms can do to get the Victory alone.</hi> Others, who tranſlate the former part of the Verſe to the ſame ſenſe that I have done, tranſlate the laſt part thus: the <hi>excellence of induſtry, is Wiſdom.</hi> That is, Wiſdom in this excels all other Tools that thy are blunted by uſe; but it is ſharpened thereby. And therefore they, the more they are uſed, give them that employ them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labour; but this; the more it is exerciſed, gives us the leſs: Thus <hi>Maldonate.</hi> Some in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, If iron be blunt, it muſt be ſharpned; and ſo must the Sword of Justice (when by the negligence of Officers, it hath loſt its edge, and the Earth is filled with violence, with thefts and adulteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be reſumed and whetted by the Magistrate, to the ſevere puniſhment of ſuch wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſeems to expreſs the ſenſe of the <hi>Vulgar:</hi> as Iron being blunted, is not ſharpned without great labour! ſo the Companion of great diligence, is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: or Wiſdom cannot be attained without great industry. Which others, that follow that Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſs thus more largely: As a Knife or ſuch like Instrument, having lain long ruſty, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much whetting be ſharpned again: ſo the mind that is grown dull by long ſloth and negligence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great labour, ſtudy and exerciſe, to restore it to its former vigour. Which may be applied to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that is decayed, and cannot, without a wonderful diligence and prudence in thoſe that have the management of things, be recovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:46873:104"/>
There are thoſe who look upon it only as an Admonition what may be done by mere induſtry and pains-taking, though a man have not much wit, nor be much befrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by others; and yet gets up wonderfully in the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[I] V. 11.]</hi> In the Expoſition of this alſo there is much variety; according as the Hebrew Phraſe <hi>Maſter of the tongue,</hi> is expounded, either of a <hi>mere Babler,</hi> and looſe Talker; or of a <hi>Backbiter</hi> and Slanderer. I have taken it in the latter ſenſe; as St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the Vulgar Edition, doth. And the former part of the Verſe, may either ſignifie a Serpent that <hi>is</hi> not inchanted; or that <hi>cannot be</hi> inchanted, by any means. For ſome ſuch ſort of Serpents there were, as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> obſerves (L. <hi>3. de ſacr. Animal.</hi> C. <hi>6.</hi> Part. II.) and as appears out of <hi>Jer. VIII. 17.</hi> and other places of holy Scripture. Unto which, I think, the Backbiter and Detracter may be beſt compared: for nothing will reſtrain his virulent humour: nor defend one from the miſchief which he doth in ſecret. I have connected this Verſe alſo with the precedent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as it may be, though we ſhould take the Words in the common ſenſe: which is this; that as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will bite, if he be not charmed; ſo will he do miſchief that talks much, if he govern not his tongue with great Wiſdom. Or, as others interpret the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Verſe, a mans words though never ſo eloquent (for ſo the Word <hi>lachaſch</hi> is uſed, <hi>III. Iſai. 3.</hi>) will do no good, to pacifie a Princes mind; if he be not charmed at the very first, before he have fixed his anger.</p>
                     <p>Others take this Verſe ſeparate from the reſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no more by it, than this; that a Calumniator is like a Serpent, that bites ſecretly; without ſo much as giving warning by its hiſſing. So <hi>Melancthon;</hi> who truly obſerves, that calumny is a moſt grievous Peſtilence; which rages and deſtroys whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46873:104"/>For it firſt kindles Diſſentions; and thence ariſe Confuſion of Religion, Wars and Deſolations. Or, according to our Tranſlation. <hi>A Babler can no more refrain from blurting out his own or others Secrets, than a Serpent, if he be not charmed, can do from biting.</hi> Which may be referred alſo to the matter foregoing, in this manner: He that gives himſelf a liberty of talking of every thing, blurts out even the Secrets, and the Vices of Princes; whereby he not only makes himſelf odious, but procures his own destruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> The <hi>three</hi> following Verſes, may be alſo referred to the ſame matter; and the latter part of this, is capable of another ſenſe, than that in our Tranſlation; which is this: That <hi>a Fools lips ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all that a wiſer man hath ſaid.</hi> So St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> expounds it. There would be leſs harm in folly, ſaith he, if it would be content with its own ruſtick ignorance: but it affects to contradict the dictates of Wiſdom, and to affront prudent perſons; nay to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and overthrow them; whereby it becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wicked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 14.]</hi> And it is in vain to hope to amend this; Becauſe, as <hi>Solomon</hi> here obſerves, a Fool thinks himſelf in this very thing to be wiſe and learned; that he is able to multiply words; though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo confuſed, without head or foot (as we ſpeak) and he ſay the ſame thing over and over again, in a Round; as the LXX ſeem to underſtand the Word <hi>holleloth</hi> madneſs (in the foregoing Verſe) which they tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as if it were from the Hebrew Word, which ſignifies a <hi>dance. Melancthon</hi> underſtands theſe <hi>three</hi> Verſes, as if they expreſſed the difference between wiſe Counſellors or Teachers; and ſuch as are fooliſh, but fanſie themſelves very wiſe: though they direct their Counſels and Inſtructions, merely by their own, or others blind affections.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 15.]</hi> He refers alſo this Verſe (where I have put two ſenſes together) unto the ſame thing. Theſe perverſe wiſe men, ſaith he, make a great buſtle to no purpoſe; and, endeavouring to reform many things, bring lamentable events upon themſelves and others: becauſe they are ignorant of the ſenſe of Mankind; and conſider not the weight of buſineſs; nor diſcern what it fit to be done. Which is comprehended in theſe Words,<hi>They know not the way to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or to the Court:</hi> But are like the Shepherd, ſaith he, who coming to Court, had a Looking-Glaſs beſtowed on him; in which contemplating himſelf, he fell into admiration of his own beauty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grew ſo inſolent, that he was not only thrown out with diſgrace, but broke his neck.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[p] V. 16.]</hi> From hence <hi>Solomon</hi> takes occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us, that the miſery or welfare of a people, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends very much upon the King that governs them. Who if he be a Child muſt be governed by others: and if they prove bad, as commonly they are, all things go to wrack. This ſeems to be the ſenſe of this Verſe: where by a <hi>Child</hi> I underſtand a Prince to whom the Sceptre falls in his minority: though it may be taken (as <hi>Jo. Forſterus</hi> expounds) for one that is <hi>rerum imperitus,</hi> unskilful in buſineſs (as in <hi>I Jer. 6.7. III. Iſai. 4.</hi>) and I have not omitted the common Interpretation, which underſtands it of ſuch a weak <hi>Prince,</hi> as is wholly governed by his paſſions, and lets the worst of men govern him.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46873:105"/>Who, like Children, think all is well, if they may but play, and follow their pleaſure. Which they take ſo greedily that they are drinking, when they ſhould be at Council; dancing, when they ſhould be judging Cauſes. So <hi>Jo. Drufius,</hi> I remember, expounds <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the morning,</hi> in his Annotations on <hi>XVI. Numb. 5.</hi> where he applies that place of <hi>Jeremiah XXI. 12.</hi> to illustrate this: and obſerves that the <hi>morning</hi> is the time of Judgment and Counſel; as the <hi>evening</hi> is for mirth or compotations. According to that of <hi>Socrates, In the Morning Counſel, in the Evening Converſation.</hi> And that of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, <hi>Non iudicant in hora Ebrietatis;</hi> they do not ſit to judge in the hour of drinking; <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Evening. Which is ſo prejudicial to Government, that there was a Law among the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that no Magistrate whatſoever ſhould drink any Wine at all, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>[r] V. 18.]</hi> I have referred this and the next Verſe, unto the ſame matter. And this repreſents, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is to be very diligent and careful to make up the ſmalleſt Breaches, and correct the beginning of Diſorders; by ſhowing what ruine attends upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine ſloth, remiſsneſs and negligence. Which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>two</hi> moſt ſignificant Words; the firſt <hi>(ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs)</hi> implying ſuch a ſluggiſh temper, that a man will move neither hand to any Work: the other <hi>(idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)</hi> ſuch a remiſsneſs and liſtleſsneſs, as there is in a man that is aſleep: when his <hi>hands hang down</hi> (as the Phraſe is <hi>XII. Hebr. 12.</hi>) which ſeems to be the import of <hi>ſhiphluth</hi> in this place; coming from a Word that ſignifies humble, and dejected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f]</hi> The next Verſe repreſents the vaſt power of money: which therefore a Prince ſhould be ſure to have at command; becauſe it commands all other things. As he finds, when he is in want of it; and is thereby
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46873:106"/>tempted to ſqueeze his people unjuſtly; or to ſet all things to ſale: which is another way of expounding that Phraſe, <hi>Money anſwers all things.</hi> I cannot omit here to note, that it would not be abſurd, if this Verſe ſhould be connected with v. <hi>17.</hi> to ſignifie the happineſs of a Nation, whoſe Prince taken care that his people want not proviſion (<hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the Language of the Hebrews ſignifying all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for humane life) but eſpecially that the money of the Nation, whereby all things are purchaſed, be not exported.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[t] V. 20.]</hi> But whatſoever negligence, or profuſeneſs and waſte there be; it ſhould not provoke any wiſe or good man, to ſpeak contemptuouſly of his Sovereign, or of his Ministers: if he conſider merely how unſafe it is, to make ſuch reflections on him. For there are no ears ſo faithful, no place ſo ſecret, as that they may be truſted with ſuch Words: <hi>the ears of Kings,</hi> according to the old Saying, <hi>being as long as their arms.</hi> That is, they can as eaſily diſcover crimes, as puniſh them: they have Spies on purpoſe every where; or men to ingratiate themſelves, will turn Accuſers; or loyal perſons, may, ſome way or other, come by the knowledge of it, and think themſelves bound to let their Sovereign know, who are his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>Thus moſt Interpreters, and the moſt learned underſtand this Verſe; And therefore I have followed no other Interpretation in my Paraphraſe. For thus that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable perſon, <hi>S. Bochartus</hi> gloſſes upon theſe Words <hi>(Epiſt. qua reſpond. ad 3. Quaeſt. p. 37.)</hi> The true mind of <hi>Solomon</hi> is, that Kings do not want their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Emiſſaries and curious Obſervers; by whom they learn what is most ſecret. Which was the reaſon that <hi>Midas</hi> was repreſented by the Poets with Aſſes ears; becauſe he had thoſe that listned and hearkned in all parts of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46873:107"/>and brought him News of every thing, that was but whiſpered by his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And thus St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> the ſimple ſenſe is, that we take care we be not overcome by anger and fury, to ſpeak evil of our Prince, or detract from him: for he may ſome way or other hear it, contrary to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and make us ſuffer for our ungoverned tongue. That<hi>'s</hi> the meaning, ſaith he, of the laſt part of the Verſe; which is an Hyperbolical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like that, in common ſpeech, when we ſay: <hi>The Walls that are conſcious to what you ſpeak will diſcover it.</hi> Nay, this very Proverbial Hyperbole is uſed in good Authors, for a thing very ſecret, <hi>Unleſs ſome Bird ſaw it.</hi> So <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> in his Comedy which hath its Name from Birds.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Suidas</hi> cites this Verſe out of the ſame Poet (which more illuſtrates the ſenſe I have given of this Phraſe in the Paraphraſe.)</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But I am not ſatisfied whether <hi>Solomon</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſomething elſe; and intimated that ſome <hi>Prophet</hi> might make the diſcovery: as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did of many things ſpoken in the Kings own Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>2 Kings VI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe,</hi> by <hi>that which hath Wings,</hi> underſtands the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Miniſters: and ſo many of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> about which, though they talk many fabulous things, yet the meaning may be, the Angels ſhall, one way or other, bring it to light, and give occaſion to the diſcovery. For, as a great man of our own obſerves (Biſh. <hi>Taylor,</hi> L. III. <hi>Duct. Dub.</hi> Ch. <hi>3.</hi> Rule <hi>3.</hi> n. <hi>3.</hi>) <hi>the Government of the other World
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46873:107"/>reaches ſtrangely even unto us;</hi> 
                        <q>and we ſpeak not a word in vain, but by the Divine Providence it is diſpoſed to purpoſes that we underſtand not. And therefore it is not ſafe to ſpeak evil of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> in our private houſes; leſt the Angel that attends us order it ſo, that it paſs into publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But as for the <hi>King</hi> (who is above the <hi>rich</hi> or mighty) <hi>call him not accurſed in thy heart:</hi> Which being a thing that can only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by God, who is the Searcher of the heart; it ſhows that, as Angels take care of the rich, the wiſe, the mighty and noble: ſo Kings are the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, as the ſame <hi>Bochartus</hi> adds, it appears from hence that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not deterr us from this ſin, by the mere fear of danger; for he lays a reſtraint not only on our words, but on our thoughts: which are known only unto God. And if we may not in thought detract from him, how much leſs ſpeak a reproachful word of him; or move rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only add two things more, and conclude this Chapter with a notable Diſcourſe of <hi>Martin Luther: firſt,</hi> that ſome of the Hebrews who take the Angels to be here meant, thereby underſtand the <hi>Devil:</hi> as our Saviour by the <hi>Fowls of the Heaven</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the evil one, <hi>XIII. Matth. 4.</hi> But eſpecially <hi>Night-birds,</hi> they ſay (who may ſeem here to be meant, where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Bed-Chamber</hi>) denote the Devil and his Angels. Whence that Proverb among the Arabians, <hi>Speak where there is no Night-Bird;</hi> that is, where no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hears.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The laſt words of the Verſe, are capable of this ſenſe (if we diſtinguiſh between <hi>Bird of the Air,</hi> and <hi>that which hath wings:</hi> taking the one for <hi>Angels,</hi> and the other for <hi>men;</hi> who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46873:108"/>to Kings as Angels do to God) that the Angels will report our blaſphemy in Heaven; and ſome or other will be found to reveal it, and carry the News of it to the King upon the Earth. <hi>Gregory Neocaeſarienſis</hi> ſuggeſts the former part of this: who thus expounds the Words, <hi>Swift and winged Meſſengers carry all to the only rich and great King; diſcharging both a ſpiritual and rational Miniſtry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will not be unuſeful, much leſs unſeaſonable, in ſuch an unruly Age as this, to let the Reader underſtand how deeply the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> of Religion laid this Precept to heart; by tranſcribing ſome of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Admonitions, in his Annotations, on this Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The worſe and the more malignant, ſaith he, the World is, the more ſtudious and laborious <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> teaches us to be, in the doing our Duty. Particularly, in <hi>honouring Magiſtracy;</hi> becauſe it is a Divine Ordinance, and the better part of the World: by which God manages all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun. But the ungodly begin their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, chiefly in the contempt of Magiſtrates; when they bear how God blames and reproves them in the holy Scriptures. But it belongs to the Divine Office to find fault with Magiſtrates and to rebuke them. And therefore, though thou heareſt it, yet do not imitate it. For thou art not God; nor the Ordainer, no nor the Reformer and Reſtorer of the Divine Ordinance. But as God reproves them, ſo thee alſo, in the holy Scriptures; that thou mayſt do thy Duty, and not meddle with what belongs to them. Whereas thou forgetting the Beam in thy own eye, beginneſt to ſpy the Mote in another mans: correcting thy Superiors, by whom thou rather art to be corrected. And if thou ſhouldſt ſuſtain their Office, wouldſt offend more than they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46873:108"/>do, and not do ſo much good, as is performed by them. The meaning therefore of <hi>Solomon</hi> is this; I have ſpoken much of Princes, how they undo the World; but do thou reverence them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that; for they are not an humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but a Divine. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> indeed calls the King an <hi>humane Creature;</hi> becauſe he is aſſumed from among men, but his authority is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: And though Princes be bad, they are to be honoured becauſe of this Ordinance of God. Why then wilt thou ſpeak evil of thoſe, who are vexed with ſo many and ſuch great cares and labours for thy peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they be good? and if they be bad and fooliſh, their own impiety is miſchief enough to them, and brings them into ſufficient danger. Bear with them then, and compaſſionate them; rather than rail upon them, and revile them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Yes, will ſome anſwer; but we may ſay what we pleaſe of their Miniſters. Not ſo, ſaith the Wiſe man in this place, <hi>Curſe not the rich,</hi> i. e. men in great Authority under the King. For (as the ſame <hi>Luther</hi> diſcourſes upon the <hi>firſt</hi> Verſe of this Chapter) <q>juſt as we ſee Flies fall into a Pot of excellent Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there dying and corrupting, ſpoil it all: ſo when excellent Counſel is given in the Kingdom, in the Senate, in War; behold there comes ſome miſchievous Knave or other, and utterly daſhes it, ſo that it hath no effect.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.] Charity</hi> being the Subject of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the firſt <hi>ſix</hi> Verſes of this Chapter (as was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46873:111"/>obſerved in the <hi>Argument</hi>) he begins with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of it: thoſe who, as our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>(XIV. Luke 14.)</hi> are not likely to recompence us again. Thus this firſt Verſe (about which there are various conceits) I think may be moſt naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And it is a very ancient Expoſition, as appears by the Words of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus;</hi> which are theſe in Engliſh: <hi>It is juſt to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it may ſeem to be loſt, (and thrown away, as we ſpeak) like the bread that is caſt upon the water; yet, in proceſs of time thy love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will appear not to be unprofitable and without fruit.</hi> And after the ſame manner <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> in after-times (Orat. XIX. pag. <hi>298.</hi>) ſpeaking of the liberality of his Father to the Poor; ſaith, He proceeded upon this Maxim: That it is much better, for the ſake of thoſe who may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to give to thoſe who are unworthy, than for fear of beſtowing our Charity upon the unworthy, let worthy people want it. To which that ſeems (ſaith he) to belong, which we read in <hi>Solomon [Caſt thy bread upon the water] Which is not thrown away and quite loſt, in the account of him that juſtly eſtimates things; but is ſent thither where all that we do is laid up; and ſhall in due ſeaſon meet us again, though we think not of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, to ſtrengthen this, it is obſerved by ſome, that <hi>water,</hi> in Scripture ſignifie, great affliction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, <hi>XVIII. Pſal. 17. LXVI. 12.</hi> And therefore the ſenſe of the Proverb is not, of ſowing in a fertile Ground, by the Rivers; or in a Soil well watered, from whence men naturally expect a fruitful Crop (as ſome expound it) but of ſowing (i. e. giving alms) there, from whence we expect no fruit; no more than if we threw the Seed in a rapid River;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46873:112"/>in which it is carried away, no body knows whither, and ſeems utterly loſt.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it may be applied alſo to ungrateful people; as I have touched in the Paraphraſe: and I ſhall not trouble the Reader with other Expoſitions, which may be found in moſt Commentators; only naming this of <hi>Maldonate</hi> (which agrees well enough with that which I have followed) <hi>give to the poor, whoſe miſeries are ſo great that their faces are all wet and beſmeared with tears.</hi> And though there be many of them, be not ſparing, if thou art able to receive them; for <hi>waters</hi> ſignifie ſometime a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, in the Scripture Language. But that's the ſenſe of the next Verſe; and therefore upon the <hi>face of the waters,</hi> is as much as upon thoſe, <hi>who will be gone preſently,</hi> like the Waters of a River; and never bring any thing back to us, to reward us: if they do, is more than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                     <p>As for the Word <hi>Bread</hi> it ſignifies any benefit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poor may be ſupported: eſpecially all ſorts of Food (<hi>1 Sam. XIV. 24.</hi> where it comprehends <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and every thing that was edible) more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that Food which is made of Corn, <hi>III. Gen. 19.</hi> and from thence ſignifies <hi>Corn</hi> it ſelf, of which Bread is made, <hi>XXVIII. Iſai. 28.</hi> And ſo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> here expounds it; agreeable to what I ſaid above, of ſowing ſeed in the Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> And as in the firſt Verſe he hath reſpect to the <hi>quality</hi> of the perſons, unto whom we are to give; ſo here to the <hi>number</hi> of them, and the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of our Alms: which is expected perhaps by a great multitude. Yet let not that damp it (ſaith he) out of a fancy that it will undo us, to relieve them all: but, if we be able, let us help them; and though more ſtill come when we have extended our Charity according to our utmoſt ability, let us rather go beyond
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46873:112"/>it (as the Apoſtle ſaith the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Chriſtians did, <hi>2 Cor. VIII. 3.</hi>) than let miſerable Creatures periſh. Thus <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> ſeems to underſtand theſe Words <hi>Seven, yea eight. Seven</hi> is a complete number; <hi>eight</hi> added to it denotes ſomethings above that which we account perfection. His Words are theſe, that <hi>his Father gave not only,</hi>

I will only note, that here again <hi>Solomon</hi> contradicts the Vulgar Principle upon which covetous Wretches move; and directs the quite contrary. They think all is loſt, that is given away in Charity: no ſuch matter, ſaith the Preacher (v. <hi>1.</hi>) the fruit of it will be found hereafter, beyond what can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. O, ſaith the covetous man again, I know not what will be hereafter: now I have enough, but in the latter end of my life I may want; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is beſt to ſave whilſt I may. No, ſaith the Preacher, for that very reaſon, give; becauſe thou knoweſt not what may be hereafter; when that may be taken away from thee, which now thou wilt not beſtow upon needy people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> In this Verſe, he illuſtrates both the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of it. The former by the <hi>Clouds,</hi> which are a fit Emblem of Charity: the ſecond, by the <hi>Trees;</hi> which can bring forth Fruit no longer
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46873:113"/>than they continue joined to their Root; from which being ſeparated, they bear no more, nor can be fixed to their Root, as the Clouds may be filled with Water, again. So I have interpreted the latter part of this Verſe: which <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtands as if it meant no more than the foregoing: <hi>Do good to men without diſtinction; like him who, when he cuts down a Tree, regards not which way it falls.</hi> I omit other Interpretations, and ſhall only mention <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Gloſs upon this Verſe, which is ingenious enough. He urges us, ſaith he, to do good, while, we live, by two Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the <hi>profit of it,</hi> becauſe we ſhall receive more than we give; like the Clouds, which receive from the Earth but a thin Vapour; which they return to it in moſt copious Showres. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> From the <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of being in a capacity to do good when we are dead; for then, like a Tree, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as we are when Death ſeizes us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never be reſtored to our former condition again. <hi>Corranus</hi> alone (as far as I can find) expounds the latter part thus, in his Annotations: <hi>A Tree in what place ſoever it is planted, there abides, and brings forth Fruit: and ſo ought we to help others by all manner of means: in whatſoever place or time we live.</hi> And he takes <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> for all Parts of the World. If any think fit to apply this, unto the unalterable condition wherein we muſt remain in the other World (like a Tree cut down, which if it fall toward the North, cannot change its poſiture, and turn to the South) they cannot follow a fitter Gloſs upon the Words, than this of <hi>Luther</hi>'s. <hi>If the Lord find thee in the South; that is, fruitful and rich in good works, it will be well: but if in the North; that is, barren, of good works, it will be ill with thee. Howſoever thou art found, ſo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46873:113"/>thou ſhalt be judged; and ſo thou ſhalt likewiſe receive.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And then follows here an Admonition to take the firſt opportunity of doing good; and not to deferr it becauſe now it may ſeem unſeaſonable, and we fanſie it may do better another time. Which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> extends unto all other things, as well as Alms. <hi>There is no greater, or more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent impediment of action</hi> (ſaith be, in the Concluſion of the Firſt Chapter of the VIIIth. Book of <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) <hi>than an over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation of decency; and of that other Ceremony, attending on it, which is too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous election of time and opportunity.

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus that great Prince <hi>Xerxes</hi> (otherwiſe not very prudent, ſpeaks very diſcreetly in <hi>Herodotus</hi> (L.VII.) <hi>Be not fearful of all things; nor conſider eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing minutely: for if in the conſidertion of buſineſs, thou wilt weigh every thing alike, thou ſhalt never be able to do any thing.</hi> And thus <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> underſtands this place, <hi>As events are not in our power</hi> (which he takes to be the meaning of v. <hi>3.</hi>) <hi>ſo he that will have certain and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed events</hi> (that is, ſuch and ſuch things come to paſs) <hi>before he act, will never attempt any thing.</hi>

                     <p>And ſo a great Divine of our own expounds it; <q>If we will ſuſpend our reſolution, till we can bethink our ſelves, of ſomething free from all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; in moſt of our deliberations, we ſhall never reſolve upon any thing at all: God having ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered things, that every commodity hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiouſneſs, every conveniency ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience attending it; which many times, all the

                     <p>Others think a new Diſcourſe here begins for the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Book; and that after all he had ſaid of happineſs, he adviſes every one to think of another life, and not expect to find it in this.</p>
                     <p>Or, as ſome underſtand him, his meaning is, <hi>Now you have ſeen, wherein happineſs doth not, and wherein it doth conſiſt; therefore do not either imagine there is none at all here in this World, or that it is greater than really it is: But take a middle courſe, which I have ſhown you, and look upon this life as having pleaſure in it, but not abſolutely perfect; yet ſuch as our condition will permit; begun here, and to be completed in another World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> The beginning of this Verſe I have expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Hebrew, where the Words run thus, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf tranſlates them, <hi>If a man live many years, let him rejoyce in all theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. And the latter part of the Verſe, I have ſuppoſed, contains two Motives to moderation in our preſent enjoyments, and to make us think of doing ſome good with them, as the higheſt pleaſure of all. Becauſe they will have an end, when we can no longer enjoy them; and becauſe, while we have them, they run away apace, as all that follows will do; and leave us empty and diſſatisfied, unleſs we have made a good uſe of them: upon which we may reflect, when they are gone, with ſome pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46873:115"/>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> To thoſe Motives, he here adds the moſt conſiderable thing of all: which is expounded <hi>two</hi> ways by Interpreters. Some taking theſe Words as a <hi>permiſſion,</hi> under ſuch reſtraints as he mentions in the end of the Verſe: others, as <hi>ironically</hi> and <hi>ſarcaſtically</hi> (as the Greek Phraſe is ſpoken; by way of mockage, and bitter ſcoff. The two <hi>firſt</hi> Phraſes (<hi>rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>let thy heart cheer thee</hi>) incline to the former way; being commonly uſed in a good ſenſe: the two <hi>laſt (walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thy eyes)</hi> unto the other way, being commonly uſed in a bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſcope of the place, and the coherence muſt determine it. And as the LXX and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> go the first way; ſo it agrees best, in my opinion, with what went before; and therefore ſo I have paraphraſed it. And conſidering that they are two different Words in the beginning of the Verſe, which we tranſlate as if they were the ſame (viz. <hi>young man,</hi> and <hi>youth</hi>) I have not done amiſs, I think but expreſſed them more ſignificantly, by theſe Words, <hi>childiſh youth.</hi> And ſo they are distinguiſhed in the last Verſe; where that Word which here we tranſlate <hi>youth,</hi> we more truly tranſlate <hi>childhood:</hi> which goes before youth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> Here I have followed the judgment of St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> who under <hi>anger</hi> (or <hi>grief</hi>) comprehends all the perturbations of the mind: and under <hi>evil of the fleſh,</hi> all the hurtful pleaſures of the Body. And accordingly I have expounded the whole Verſe, with reſpect to the danger Youth is in, by the fiery motions of both ſorts: the former of which incline men to imitate the Wild Beaſts; the other ſink them, into the condition of the dullest Brutes.</p>
                     <p>The word we here tranſlate <hi>youth</hi> ſignifies the <hi>peep of day,</hi> in our Language; the <hi>appearing of the morning:</hi> and therefore is to be understood of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46873:115"/>upon the most pleaſant time of our life. Which, as well as <hi>childhood,</hi> is but <hi>vanity;</hi> that is, preſently vaniſhes (as ſome will have it) and will be ſoon gone: or rather, Childhood and Youth, ſignifying all that is done in that Age of our life; the meaning is, it is an Age of great levity, folly and indiſcretion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, as <hi>Luther</hi> obſerves, the great care of mankind ſhould be to ſeaſon <hi>Youth</hi> with right Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and a good ſenſe of things; and then it is not to be denied all pleaſures, of which it is very deſirous; much leſs ſhut up from the very ſight of them, for it abbhors ſolitude. And this is to begin at the wrong end of Education; which muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied firſt to the mind, not to the Body: And when the Mind is well tinctured, the Body will be eaſily governed. That is, neither follow filthy pleaſures; nor be carried away with furious paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The benefit of which will be unſpeakable; for they that live pleaſantly and quietly in Youth, are likely to arrive at and enjoy a comfortable Old Age.</p>
                     <p>Some begin the XIIth. Chapter at this Verſe, and others begin it with the foregoing: but I have followed our Tranſlation, and the moſt Interpreters.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.]</hi> From the conſideration of what he had ſaid in the Concluſion of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>that Youth is attended with folly, and folly attended with deſtruction</hi> (as <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently explains thoſe Words) he begins this with the moſt weighty Leſſon: which ought to be perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, and beaten into the mind and memory of young men, <hi>viz.</hi> That they would reflect ſo far as to conſider, who gave them their being; and what, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, they owe unto Him: who as He is the ſole Author of all things that give us any delight; ſo He is of all the abilities and faculties, which make us capable to take pleaſure in them; and the ſole Diſpoſer likewiſe of all opportunities, that bring us and thoſe Delights together.</p>
                     <p>All this may well be comprehended in the Word <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> (if this place be compared with <hi>XL. Iſai. 28. XLV. 7.18. LXV. 17, 18.</hi>) Which being in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> a Word of the Plural Number, ſome from thence draw the Myſtery of the Holy Trinity: which I cannot certainly, ſay is here intended, becauſe it is very ordinary in the Scripture to put the Plural for the Singular; eſpecially when God is ſpoken of. Thus when the Iſraelites had made the golden Calf, they ſaid, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, O Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. (ſo we tranſlate it, <hi>XXXII. Exod. 4.</hi>) as if there had been more Gods than one in that Calf. But it ſhould be tranſlated, <hi>This is thy God, O Iſrael;</hi> as appears by what follows, <hi>which brought thee out of the land of Egypt:</hi> ſignifying they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in this Image Him, who had wrought that great deliverance for them. And thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> there underſtands it; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon <hi>1</hi> Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Queſt. <hi>10,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46873:119"/>
More places, like to this, are obſerved by <hi>Bochartus</hi> (L. II. <hi>de Animal. Sacr.</hi> C. <hi>34.</hi> P. <hi>1.</hi>) in whom the Learned Reader may find many ſuch Latine Words, that are only of the <hi>Plural,</hi> not <hi>Singular</hi> Number. And I will only mention one remarkable place, (which he might have added) <hi>1 Sam. XXVIII. 9.</hi> where the Woman ſays, ſhe ſaw <hi>Gods</hi> aſcending out of the Earth: and <hi>Saul</hi> thereupon asks her, <hi>What form is he of?</hi> underſtanding ſhe ſaw a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon.</p>
                     <p>But what ever becomes of this, we Chriſtians (to whom this Myſtery is now plainly revealed) ought when we read ſuch places as theſe, to think of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have unto God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, into whoſe Name we are baptized. And not only to <hi>conſider</hi> ſuch things as are above-mentioned; but to be <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> with them (for that is here included in the Word <hi>Remember</hi>) according unto their weight and importance.</p>
                     <p>And to do this betime, the firſt thing we do; becauſe <hi>the days of our youth,</hi> are our beſt and choiceſt days (as the Word in the Hebrew ſignifies; whence in <hi>2 Sam. VI. 1.</hi> where <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to gather all the <hi>choſen men,</hi> the LXX hath <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the <hi>young men</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) in which we are apt to take the greateſt delight in our ſelves, or in any thing truly delightful: our ſpirits being then most freſh, lively and vigorous. So that the meaſure of our delight, whether in our ſelves or in any thing without us, being then truly taken, it would constrain us unto an equal delight in Him who is the Author of both and unto a correſpondent gratulation for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if we deferr this <hi>remembrance</hi> till Old Age come upon us, when life grows a burden, and the wonted delights of it are either irkſome or inſipid (unpleaſant, or without all taste or reliſh) our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46873:120"/>for them will be but faint; our gratulation worthleſs; our Devotion cold and lumpiſh: as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> excellently gloſſes upon theſe Words, B. XI. upon the Creed, C. <hi>33.</hi> Which, he had expreſſed long before, more briefly in his <hi>Treatiſe of Faith,</hi> Chap. <hi>8.</hi> p. <hi>125;</hi> thus, <hi>The Inventory of what we have received from God in our Creation, ſhould be taken in thoſe days wherein we moſt delight; becauſe then the Characters of his Bleſſings beſtowed upon us, and their true worth, are moſt freſh and ſenſible in all our faculties: well knowing, that if we deferr this Survey till Old Age, in which life it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a burden, our return of thanks for fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and the unpleaſant appertinencies, will be but wearyiſh.</hi> And plainer still in his II. Book upon God<hi>'s Attributes,</hi> Ch. XI. p. <hi>95. Then the Prints of God's Creative Power, are moſt freſh in our Nature; and might tranſmit a fairer Copy, and truer eſtimate of the Creator's Goodneſs unto Old Age, than Old Age can take any,</hi> &amp;c. Which I have repeated the oftner, in ſeveral forms of ſpeech, in hope that one or other of them may touch the heart of young men, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them by frequent reflection upon the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of health and strength, upon the activity of their Body, the quickneſs of their ſenſe and ſpirit, to ingroſs them deeply in their memory; before the <hi>evil days come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So <hi>Solomon</hi> calls our decrepit Old Age; both becauſe they are void of all pleaſure, as he ſaith in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words; and becauſe they are attended likewiſe with ſo many inconveniences and miſeries, that it is hard to number them. But he gives us ſome account of them, in his admirable Deſcription of decrepit Age, v. <hi>2, 3, 4, 5, 6:</hi> which abundantly confirms that ſpeech of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book <hi>de Senecture,</hi>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:46873:120"/>that Old Age proves ſo odious unto moſt men, <hi>ut Onus ſe Aetna gravius dicant ſuſtinere,</hi> that they complain of a load that lies heavier than Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> Theſe infirmities he demonſtrates to be very great, becauſe decrepit Age conſiſts in the univerſal decay of the whole frame of Nature: Which I take to be the meaning of the <hi>Sun, the light, the Moon and Stars,</hi> being darkned. For as in a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the extinction or falling down of theſe ſignifies, in the Prophetical Language, the ſubverſion of that frame of Government (as, to omit abundance of other places, may be ſeen in what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Egypt, XXXII. 7, 8.</hi>) ſo the darkning of theſe in the Natural Body of man, ſignifies, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its total decay and nearneſs to a diſſolution: the tumbling (as we ſpeak) of an Old Man into his Grave; like a ruinous old houſe which can ſtand no longer; for ſo the Metaphor is carried on, v. <hi>3.</hi> And then the <hi>return of Clouds after the Rain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the diſmal condition a man is in at that time: when one trouble treads upon the heels of another: which is no ſooner gone, but the like, or a new one, comes in its room. And ſo the Words may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>The Clouds return, and after that the Rain:</hi> that is, there is a ſucceſſion of miſery, of grief, pain, or weakneſs, drawing on one another. There are ſome who apply the darkning of <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> to the mind of man (as one would think, indeed, he ſhould ſay ſomething of that; and all the following deſcription belonging wholly to the Body, we muſt find it here or not at all) but ſtill I conceive that he intends only in general, to ſignifie the failing of the mind in all its faculties and powers; without a reſpect to ſome particular diſtinct faculty in each of theſe Words. But they who think the inward
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46873:121"/>powers are here intended, are not content to reſt in ſuch a general meaning; but will have ſomething in particular ſignified, by every one of them. And then they do but gueſs, which gives me the liberty to interpoſe my conjectures alſo: that by the <hi>Sun</hi> may be meant the Soul it ſelf; by the <hi>Light,</hi> its Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; by the <hi>Moon,</hi> the Will; by the <hi>Stars,</hi> all the Nations in the Mind and Memory, with all the affections and paſſions in the Will: juſt as <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dream, ſignified his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Brethren.</hi> And ſo the ſenſe of this Verſe is, the Mind of man grows feeble in all its powers; the Underſtanding dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, the Memory forgetful; the Reaſon weak and childiſh (giving ſuch a feeble light, that it can neither direct our ſelves nor others) the Will liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in all its deſires, dull about our greateſt concerns, wavering and inconſtant in all its reſolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I judge it more reaſonable, as I ſaid, to reſt in the Interpretation firſt mentioned (which I am ſure is agreeable to the holy Language in other places) that hereby is only repreſented in general, the univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the faculties of the upper part of man, his Soul. Which ſenſe I have comprehended together with the other in my Paraphraſe: and not neglected this, in which others acquieſce, that theſe Words ſignifie <hi>the miſeries an Old man feels, both night and day.</hi> As for thoſe who hereby underſtand the dimneſs of the eyes, it being expreſſed afterward, v. <hi>3.</hi> I have taken no notice of their ſenſe: But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is, which is worth mentioning. For the meaning may be, <hi>There is nothing but darkneſs:</hi> i. e. a moſt uncomfortable condition; like that, when the Heavens are clouded day and night (as they were in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage, <hi>XXVII. Acts 20.</hi>) and when one Cloud hath ſpent it ſelf in the Tempeſt, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately ſucceeds it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:46873:121"/>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> As in the foregoing Verſe he gave a general deſcription of the decay of the whole Body (and of the internal faculties of the mind together therewith) ſo here he enters into the Particulars. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Body to be like an Houſe or Tabernacle (unto which it is frequently compared, not only in the Scripture, but all other Authors) he reſembles the Shoulders, Arms and Hands, to the <hi>Keepers of the Houſe:</hi> becauſe by them we defend our ſelves from dangers; adminiſter both Food and Phyſick; exerciſe all manner of Arts and Manufactures (as we call them) as long as they have any ſtrength remaining in them. Which Old Age takes away, the Nerves, Tendons and Ligaments ſo flagging, that theſe <hi>Keepers</hi> quiver and ſhake (<hi>tremble</hi> we render it) and grow ſo uſeleſs that we can no way help our ſelves or others with them.</p>
                     <p>And then he compares the Thighs, Legs and Feet, to <hi>ſtrong men:</hi> they being the Supporters and Pillars, as it were, of the whole Fabrick, which hold it up; till Old Age quite diſables them for this Office, and makes the Knees <hi>bend,</hi> under the burden of the Body alone.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of which follows; in that the <hi>Grinders fail,</hi> &amp;c. in which Metaphor he compares the <hi>Teeth</hi> in the Jaws above and below, to the upper and nether Mill-ſtone. For they by cutting, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chewing of the Meat, prepare it to be diſſolved in the Stomach, and turned into nouriſhment (as the Corn is ground between thoſe Stones into Meal, and ſo prepared for making Bread, and other ſuch like uſes) but in time drop out of their: Sockets; or are broken, ſo that they can grind no longer.</p>
                     <p>And the like decay we find in the ſight of the eyes; which he means by <hi>thoſe that look out of the Windows.</hi> All thoſe <hi>Coats, Humours, and Nerves,</hi> that make up the eyes: which are ſet in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46873:122"/>two <hi>holes</hi> (as the Word is) or <hi>hollow places</hi> in the Forehead (like the Windows in the houſe) and have a round hole alſo in the midſt of them, called the <hi>Pupil</hi> of the Eye (like a Caſement) through which all things are tranſmitted to the inward ſenſe of Seeing. Until the <hi>Skins,</hi> and the <hi>humours</hi> alſo, grow too thick; and the very Figure of the Eye, as ſome have obſerved, be changed, by the dryneſs of the Chryſtalline humour: and then the houſe is <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Problems</hi> (Sect. <hi>31.</hi> Quaeſt. <hi>14.</hi>) expreſſes it thus, in ſhort, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when men grow into years, their ſight grows dull, becauſe <hi>in the eyes of Old men, the Skin is both hard, and alſo rugged; ſo that their ſight is obſcured.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> this Verſe hath greater difficulty in it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the beginning, <hi>and the doors ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets, when the ſound of the grinding is low.</hi> But the LXX ſuggeſt an unexceptionable ſenſe of this Paſſage, in my Opinion, which is; that <hi>they are ſhut out of all publick meetings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the lowneſs of their voice, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was as loud as a Mill.</hi> And there is little reaſon to doubt, but by <hi>doors</hi> are meant the lips (it being a frequent expreſſion in Scripture) and by the <hi>lowneſs of the ſound of grinding,</hi> the lowneſs of the voice, from the loſs of teeth, or the weakneſs of reſpiration; in ſhort, from the defect there is in the Organs of Speech.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I ſee why <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s Tranſlation may not be allowed, which is ſtill more ſimple (and therefore I have taken notice of it, in my Paraphraſe) <hi>the lips are ſhut without</hi> (ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Thus he. But it may
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46873:122"/>more exactly be tranſlated thus, by the falling low of the voice, of which the teeth are the principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the whole, I have ſometimes thought, may not incongruouſly be tranſlated in this manner: <hi>His lips are ſhut in his mouth</hi> (for the mouth is the <hi>ſtreet</hi> or high-way into this houſe of which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is ſpeaking) <hi>by the falling down of the voice of grinding;</hi> i. e. the voice that is made by grinding the Air, as it were between the teeth, and the roof of the mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It might be referred to <hi>the eating meat, ſeldom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his bad digeſtion</hi> (the Meat being ground in the Stomach, as in a Mill) if the word <hi>voice</hi> or <hi>ſound</hi> would agree to this. Which renders Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Interpretation, very difficult, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Who by <hi>doors</hi> underſtands all the <hi>inlets</hi> and <hi>outlets</hi> of the Body; and by <hi>ſtreets,</hi> the open ways and Paſſages in the Body; in which the matter of nouriſhment is conveyed, and paſſeth, without lett or moleſtation: and by <hi>ſhutting</hi> theſe doors, the ceaſing from their uſe: and by <hi>grinding,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and concoctions in the Stomach, Bowels, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, Glandules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (all which is well enough, though perhaps too Philoſophical:) and by the <hi>voice</hi> of theſe concoctions, the natural ſymptoms, ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of digeſtions; all thoſe indications, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the work of Nature to proceed aright. Which ſeems to me very far fetcht, and too great a ſtraining of the Word <hi>voice</hi> or <hi>ſound:</hi> however, I have here mentioned it, that they who are pleaſed with it, may follow that Interpretation, which is very ingenious.</p>
                     <p>The next Paſſage in this Verſe is eaſier; though it is uncertain, whether he mean that the <hi>chirping of the leaſt Bird</hi> wakes him; or that he wakes early, when the Birds do. For <hi>tzippor</hi> ſignifies all kind of Birds, great and ſmall; and may be interpreted
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46873:123"/>of the <hi>Cock</hi> as well as any other: and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, <hi>He gets up at the Cock-crowing.</hi> This laſt ſeems moſt probable, becauſe being thick of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the next Paſſage ſignifies) it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the leaſt noiſe diſturbs him. Though I confeſs the meaning may be that a <hi>ſmall noiſe wakes him ſooner, than Thunder would have done in his young days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The daughters of Muſick,</hi> if it refer to the Parts of the Body, I take not to be thoſe Organs of it, which make Muſick; but which receive it, being made. For the Hebrews call that the <hi>Son</hi> of a thing; which is fitted or deſigned for that of which it is ſaid to be the Son. Thus an Arrow is called <hi>the Son of the Bow</hi> or Quiver, <hi>XLI. Iſai. 19. III. Lament. 13.</hi> and Wheat called the <hi>Son of the Threſhing floor, XXI. Iſai. 18.</hi> and ſo the <hi>Daughters of Muſick,</hi> may be thoſe parts where Muſick is entertained. Yet there is one Objection againſt this, which lies in the Word <hi>all:</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be applied to the ears; becauſe there are but two of them: and we never ſay <hi>all the ears,</hi> but <hi>both the ears.</hi> Which makes ſome think, that hereby we are rather to underſtand all ſorts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; which are made either by inſtruments or voice. But to this it may be anſwered, that the Word <hi>all,</hi> refers to the ſeveral parts of the ear, in which the ſound is formed: both the winding chanels in the outward part; and the Tympanum, and the <hi>three</hi> cavities, and as many little bones in the inward part; together with the auditory nerve it ſelf. All which are manifeſtly contrived on purpoſe, to receive ſounds: which are born here, and ſo may be called their <hi>Daughters:</hi> which in Youth are brisk and ſpritely; but are humbled (as the LXX tranſlates it) and flat in Old Age.</p>

                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:46873:123"/>
There is no neceſſity, I acknowledge, of interpreting this Paſſage thus (though it ſeem moſt agreeable to the reſt of the deſcription) becauſe it may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>the daughters of a ſong:</hi> that is ſinging women, <hi>are not valued at all,</hi> by old men: They account them nothing worth; and would not give, as we ſay, a Farthing for them. Old <hi>Barzillai</hi> confeſſes this imperfection, <hi>2 Sam. XIX. 35.</hi> Which place Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks may very well explain this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> And it is attended with a greater, which is the paſſion of <hi>fear:</hi> unto which Old Age is very ſubject from defect of Spirits; weakneſs of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as of Bodily Organs; which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt any dangers; which Old men alſo are apt to apprehend greater than they really are. For as their heads turn giddy, if they aſcend to any high place, ſo they tremble in the plain way; for fear of a Stone, a Clod, an Hole, any unevenneſs, by the riſing or depreſſion of the Earth (for ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks the Words may be expounded, though the antient Interpreters do not favour it, <hi>He is afraid to ſtumble at the riſing or falling of the Earth</hi>) or he fears he may be puſht down by others, if he do not fall of himſelf; in a word, he knows not what he may meet withal, and therefore fears.</p>
                     <p>Or it may be expounded, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> takes it, <hi>He never thinks himſelf ſafe, though he be in an high Fortreſs.</hi> Or, dreads an high Wall, though never ſo firm; leſt it ſhould fall upon him. There are ſome that expound the firſt Words of this Verſe thus, <hi>He is afraid of Spirits,</hi> and ſeparate Souls: of thoſe excellent Beings which dwell in the Regions above. That is, <hi>he is ſuperſtitious;</hi> which I look upon as forced.</p>
                     <p>The next Part of this Deſcription, which we tranſlate <hi>Almond-tree flouriſh,</hi> moſt Interpreters take for
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46873:124"/>his <hi>head growing hoary,</hi> or <hi>white,</hi> like the Bloſſoms of the Almond-tree. Which though it make an Old man look venerably, yet brings the tidings of approaching Death: and is as certain an indication of it, as the Almond-trees bloſſoming is of the Spring; or (as others will have it) of its ſpeedy production of fruit: For it flowered, they ſay, in <hi>February,</hi> and ſhowed its Fruit in <hi>March;</hi> and thence had the name of <hi>ſhached</hi> in Hebrew; from its forward blooming, and haſty ripening into Fruit. And, to ſtrengthen this Interpretation, ſome have obſerved that an <hi>Almond</hi> was anciently called by the Greeks, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; that is, <hi>the head:</hi> from ſome reſemblance which that Fruit hath to it. What that reſemblance ſhould be, I do not underſtand; unleſs it be in the Figure of the Brain: which the Scull being removed, appears like the Shell of the Almond, when the Husk wherein it is incloſed, is peeled away. For thence <hi>Herodianus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (as I find in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> L. II, Cap. <hi>12.</hi>) derives the common Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for an Almond; becauſe next to the green Rind, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, it hath, as it were, a great many clefts, and looks as if it were ſcarified.</p>
                     <p>I ſee no apter Interpretation than this, unleſs it be that which I ſhall mention below (when I have explained the reſt of this Verſe) or we underſtand it, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith ſome did, of the <hi>Huckle-bone;</hi> which, by the waſting away of the fleſh of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, appears, nay thruſts out it ſelf; and makes their very ſitting or lying down uneaſie to them. And I find an <hi>Arabick</hi> Word of this ſound, which ſignifies a kind of Boat: and may poſſibly be the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Latine Word <hi>Scapha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this would agree well with the next Words, <hi>the Graſhopper ſhall be a burden:</hi> Which ſeem to be a deſcription of his ſtooping under the burden of Old
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46873:124"/>Age; his Shoulders, Hips and Back all bunching out; which is a load great enough for him, without any other. In ſhort <hi>he can ſcarce bear himſelf,</hi> as <hi>Melancthon</hi> expounds it: Which <hi>Avenarius</hi> thinks is a literal Tranſlation of the Words, the <hi>Graſhopper</hi> or <hi>Locuſt ſhall burthen it ſelf;</hi> that is, ſaith he, his <hi>gibbous back.</hi> Which is better than their Gloſs, who make it to ſignifie, he can ſcarce bear the weight of a Graſhopper or Locuſt. The LXX tranſlate it, <hi>the Locuſt ſhall be made fat;</hi> i. e. e. ſwell, bunch out, or be burthenſome: Which aptly denotes the <hi>knotting of the Joints</hi> (like thoſe of the Locuſt) and the riſing up of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> (or any ſuch thing in the Body of man) which make his back reſemble that of a Locuſt. And ſo <hi>Jo. Forſterus</hi> excellently tranſlates it, <hi>ut in curvo incedat dorſo, ſicut cicada,</hi> that he goes crooked in the back, like a Graſhopper. <hi>Luther</hi> alſo had this in his mind (though he did not fully explain it) when he thus gloſſed upon theſe Words: <hi>Such an Old man is like a Locuſt: for his Bones ſtick out, and his Body is ſhrunk up; ſo that he is a mere Image of Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then the next ſignifies no more than this, That the greateſt bodily pleaſures fail; and the member that ſerves thoſe pleaſures is relaxed and flaggs. For the Word <hi>haavijonah</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>deſire</hi>) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies either the <hi>Fruit</hi> of a Shrub, which the LXX take to be <hi>Capers</hi> (though <hi>avionoth</hi> ſignifie the Berries of Laurels, Myrtles, and indeed of all the leſſer ſort of Trees) or that <hi>deſire</hi> which it is ſuppoſed (according to <hi>Avicenna</hi>) to excite; or that <hi>Knob</hi> in us, which ſomething reſembles that Fruit.</p>
                     <p>There is one Interpretation of theſe <hi>three</hi> laſt Clauſes which ſeems to me not at all conſtrained, but apt enough (only it doth not make them all relate to the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46873:125"/>parts of the Body, as the reſt do) which is that of <hi>de Dieu;</hi> from whom <hi>Junius</hi> before him did not much differ. It is this, <hi>Though the Almond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree flouriſh, and the Locuſt be loadened with fat</hi> (i. e. though the pleaſures of the Spring appear and come on apace, making all things elſe to ſwell with joy) <hi>it doth not invigorate his blood, nor make it riſe, to ſtir up his deſire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is, he is juſt upon the point of leaving all things here, and going to his <hi>long home.</hi> Which ſignifies either the place to which all men go (<hi>domum ſeculi,</hi> the houſe of the whole World, whether all mankind have ever gone, and muſt go) or the place from whence he came; as <hi>Forſterus</hi> expounds <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſeculi ſui,</hi> his old houſe, out of which he firſt came forth (thus we tranſlate the Word <hi>olam, VI. Jer. 16.</hi>) or that where they muſt long abide, even till the reſurrection of the dead.</p>
                     <p>For their Friends there leave them; and can do nothing more, but mourn for them: as it follows here, <hi>The Mourners go about the Streets.</hi> That is, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the Funeral; ready to accompany the Herſe: or, they already bewail him, as a dead Corps rather than a living man; or, when he is dead, can only give him a ſolemn Funeral, and openly bewail him; not only at home, but in the Streets. For which purpoſe they ſometimes hired Mourning-men, and Women; who are the <hi>Minſtrels</hi> we read of, <hi>IX. Matth. 23.</hi> For <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith (L. III. C. <hi>15.</hi> of the <hi>Wars of the Jews</hi>) that when <hi>Joppa</hi> was taken, and he reported to be ſlain, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>&amp;c. there were many Minſtrels hired at</hi> Jeruſalem, who began to make lamentations in a doleful tone. But <hi>Gierus</hi> in his Treatiſe of the <hi>mourning of the Hebrews</hi> (p. <hi>320.</hi>) thinks <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not here mean the mourning of thoſe that accompanied the Corps to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46873:125"/>Grave, nor their walking about in mourning Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but the ſad lamentations, which their grief ſometimes moved them to make, in the very Streets: when they were weary with mourning at home, or put thereby into an extravagant paſſion; like that which the Jews ſuppoſed <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to fall into, when ſhe roſe up haſtily and went out of the houſe, <hi>XI. John 31.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> Now we are come to the moſt difficult Verſe of all; in which the Wiſe man deſcribes this houſe as falling down: that is, enumerates the evils, which immediately forego Death; of which he would have us think frequently, while the houſe is in good condition: For thoſe Words <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks are here again to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>or ever,</hi> that is, before Death ſeize on thee, and pull down this earthly Tabernacle and lay it in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>by looſning the ſilver cord.</hi> Which ſome fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſignifies all the <hi>humours of the Body;</hi> which are, as it were, <hi>the Thred of life;</hi> which the Deſtinies were ſaid to ſpin out, for a certain time, and then cut off: Others underſtand by it, <hi>the ſtring of the tongue:</hi> and <hi>Gaſpar Sanctius</hi> (upon <hi>VII. Cant. 5.</hi>) the <hi>Urine,</hi> whoſe Stream, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, reſembles a ſilver Thred, which is then broken, when it diſtils by drops; as it frequently doth in Old men. But the beſt of the Hebrew Writers by this Cord underſtand the <hi>Spinal Marrow</hi> (that is, the Pith of the Back-bone) others the <hi>Nerves;</hi> others the outward <hi>Coats</hi> of the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is little reaſon to doubt, but the Marrow down the Back, continued from the Brain, as it were, in a String or Cord, unto the very bottom of it; together with the Nerves ariſing from it; and the Filaments, Fibers and Tendons that proceed from them, are the thing here intended. Which <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſaw long
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46873:126"/>ago; <hi>the Nerves,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and Ligaments are here meant;</hi> which have literally the power of <hi>Cords,</hi> both to unite and tie together, and alſo draw. But no Body, that I know of, hath explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſo well as our Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> (in his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) who hath alſo ſolved that doubt, why they are expreſſed in the Singular Number: becauſe, though there be many of them; yet, they are the continuation of one and the ſame thing (the <hi>Fibers</hi> being nothing elſe, but the Nerves divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed; and the <hi>Nerves</hi> nothing elſe but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in like manner ſeparated, as ſo many Arms and Branches of the ſame Tree) they are all one in their <hi>Original,</hi> the Brain; they are all one in their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation,</hi> for a long ſpace in the Spine; all one in their <hi>uſe,</hi> to convey the Animal Spirits, and to be the Inſtruments of motion.</p>
                     <p>This Cord is called <hi>Silver,</hi> becauſe of its colour; being not only white, but alſo ſhinning bright and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and that when it is taken out of the Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. I omit other Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>looſned</hi> (ſhrunk up, or contracted, or removed as others tranſlate it) when it is no longer full of Spirits: and ſo the Body becomes void of ſenſe and motion, either in part or in whole.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſtep to a diſſolution, is by breaking <hi>the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bowl:</hi> and as the former related to the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, as one may ſay, of ſenſe and motion; ſo this to the Fountain: <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, and all contained in it: The Membranes, for inſtance, eſpecially that which the Ancients, from the great eſteem and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they had for it, call <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Which is that part which deeply inſinuating it ſelf, into all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractuous paſſages of the Brain (as Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> ſpeaks) and being firmly annexed thereunto; keeps every part thereof in its proper place, and due texture: ſo that whatſoever is performed within the whole compaſs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46873:126"/>of the Brain (whether the making Animal Spirits, their exerciſe therein, or their diſtribution therefrom) is principally done by the help of this Membrane. Which therefore may well be called <hi>gullath;</hi> that part of the Head which is the <hi>Spring</hi> of all the motion that comes from thence. And ſo we tranſlate the Plural of this Word, <hi>XV. Joſh. 19.</hi> and both <hi>Forſterus</hi> and <hi>Avenarius</hi> underſtand the Singular here.</p>
                     <p>And it is called <hi>golden</hi> Bowl (like that <hi>IV. Zachar. 2, 3.</hi> from whence the Oil was conveyed by Pipes unto the Lamps) for ſuch Reaſons as gave the other the name of <hi>ſilver</hi> Cord. For inſtance, in reſpect of the colour; not only becauſe that moſt precious and deep-coloured Liquor of life, is abundantly contained in the Veſſels of this Membrance; but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Membrane it ſelf is ſomewhat of a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour; and tends more towards that of Gold, than any other part whatſoever doth. But eſpecially, in reſpect of its excellency and univerſal uſe: for it being the inſtrument that doth depurate the beſt of Blood, clarifies and exalts the Vital Spirits, and ſo prepares them for animality (as they ſpeak) to what ſhould it be likened, but to that moſt perfect, beſt-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and moſt exalted Mineral of Gold?</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>breaking</hi> of this Bowl is its loſing its uſe; not being able to retain its Liquors (as a Bowl is uſeleſs when it is broken) or as Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> explains it; in the extremity of extreme Old Age, it can no longer continue its continuity; but by reaſon either of its natural dryneſs, ſhriveling into it ſelf, or of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural moiſture, imbibing excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, till it be over-full; it oft-times ſnaps aſunder, and ſo recurrs (<hi>i. e.</hi> runs back, as the Hebrew Word ſignifies) into it ſelf; from whence the Brain muſt neceſſarily ſubſide, and all the Part ſerving unto Animal motion be ſuddenly and irrecoverably daſht
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46873:127"/>in pieces. So <hi>Avenarius</hi> judiciouſly tranſlates this Paſſage, <hi>That yellow Membrane which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Brain, be trodden down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third ſtep is, the <hi>breaking of the Pitcher at the Fountain.</hi> Which is variouſly interpreted; ſome; underſtanding hereby, the inability of the Bladder to retain the Urine; others by <hi>Fountain</hi> underſtand the <hi>Liver,</hi> and by the <hi>Pitcher,</hi> the Bladder of Gall; or the Veins; which is the moſt common Opinion. But Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> rather takes it for the <hi>heart:</hi> which is indeed the <hi>Fountain of Life;</hi> and hath two diſtinct Cavities, the <hi>right</hi> and the <hi>left:</hi> out of which proceed thoſe <hi>Veins</hi> and thoſe <hi>Arteries;</hi> which carry the Blood through the whole Body, and bring it back again to the heart, in a perpetual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                     <p>And if by <hi>Pitcher</hi> we underſtand the Veins, which are the <hi>receptacle</hi> of the Blood (and the Hebrew Word ſignifies any <hi>containing Veſſel,</hi> particularly the Widows <hi>Barrel</hi> in which was her Meal, <hi>1 King. XVII. 14, 16.</hi> as well as a <hi>Barrel of Water</hi> in the next Chapter <hi>XVIII. 33.</hi>) then by the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> muſt be peculiarly underſtood the <hi>right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of the heart; which is the Original from whence the Veins have their riſe. For ſo the Hebrew Word ſignifies, not only a <hi>Fountain,</hi> but a <hi>Spring;</hi> from which Waters bubble up and burſt forth (as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it, <hi>XXXV. Iſai. 7. XLIX. 10.</hi>) in a running Stream: and therefore is ſo to be tranſlated here, the <hi>Spring</hi> or <hi>Original,</hi> viz. of the Veins, which proceed from thence. Which induced Commentators to take the <hi>Fountain</hi> here for the Liver: which they would not have done, had they underſtood, as we do now, that the Veins do not ariſe from thence, as their firſt Original; but from the right Ventricle of the Heart. And they are ſpoken of in the Singular Number (as the Nerves were before) becauſe they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46873:127"/>are all of one and the ſame nature, original and uſe.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>breaking</hi> of this Pitcher into ſhivers (as the Hebrew Word ſignifies) is the utter failing of the Veins; their ceaſing quite from their natural action and uſe. When they can no longer carry back, nor conveniently convey unto the heart that Liquor, which they properly contain: but the little Blood which remains in the cold Body of man, near his end is congealed, and ſtagnates in his Veins.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I proceed to the laſt thing, <hi>the Wheel broken at the Ciſtern.</hi> Where by the <hi>Wheel</hi> ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Lungs;</hi> which, by their continual motion, do thruſt out the Breath from them, and draw it in again to them: reſembling the <hi>Wheel of a Well,</hi> now drawing up the Bucket to it ſelf; anon letting it down again into the Well. <hi>Melancthon,</hi> by <hi>Ciſtern</hi> underſtanding the <hi>Stomach</hi> (the Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, ſaith he, a profound Cavity) takes the <hi>Wheel</hi> for the <hi>Guts</hi> adjoining thereunto: which are wrapt about one another, in a kind of Circular form; and make the <hi>Meſentery</hi> look like a Wheel. Which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems alſo to have had in his mind. But, taking it for granted that a <hi>Wheel,</hi> being an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circulation, is the Hieroglyphick of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that goes, and makes, a round in us, I think Dr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s conjecture is moſt probable; that hereby is meant the great Artery, with all its Branches: which is the great inſtrument of rotation or circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Body of man; and ſo evidently thruſts the Blood forward, that we perceive its Pulſes, forcing the Blood along its Cavity, in the Wriſts, the Temples, and other Parts of the Body. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Inſtrument to compel it, the Blood that naturally tends home to the heart, would go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:46873:128"/>
And then the <hi>Ciſtern</hi> from whence this Wheel forces the Liquor, and conveys it through all the Parts, is the <hi>left Ventricle of the Heart:</hi> to which this great Artery is annexed, and from whence it ariſeth. For a <hi>Ciſtern</hi> is a Veſſel made on purpoſe to receive a due proportion of Water, and to keep it till the time of uſe; and then conveniently to paſs it into Veſſels that are prepared to receive it from thence. And ſuch is the left Ventricle of the Heart; which in its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> as they call it, receives the Blood that is brought into it from the Lungs: and then, keeping it there a little, doth in its <hi>Syſtole</hi> paſs due proportions thereof, into the great Artery, to be diſpenſed as was ſaid before. And, for this end, there are little <hi>Valves</hi> or Falling doors placed, at the entrance and at the going out of this Ciſtern; which are like Cocks to let in, and to let out; and, by their opening or ſhutting, give convenient paſſage, or ſtoppage to the Liquor; which continually runs that way.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the <hi>breaking</hi> or <hi>ſhaking in pieces</hi> (as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterus</hi> tranſlates the Word) of this Wheel, is the ceaſing of the Pulſe ſo he in another place tranſlates it, <hi>trodden down,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> by the decay of the inſtruments of Pulſations; which can no longer perform that work. Which being abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the preſervation of life, the ceaſing of it is death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> And ſo the <hi>Body,</hi> made of a mouldering ſubſtance, being no longer a fit habitation for the Spirit (and therefore deſerted by it) which held the parts of it together, ſhall crumble again into the Earth, out of which it originally came: according to that Sentence paſſed upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Duſt thou art and unto duſt ſhalt thou return, III. Gen. 19.</hi> This Body was no better in its firſt Principles: and though now we are very fond of it, as if it were ſome goodly thing; yet, when
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46873:128"/>the Spirit leaves it, it will appear to be indeed but <hi>Duſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the nobler part of man, being of an higher Original, ſhall return to God, who ſent it into the Body; to be diſpoſed of by Him, according to the Sentence that he ſhould paſs upon it. For the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi>'s Explication of the latter part of this Verſe is very appoſite, <hi>It ſhall return, that it may ſtand in judgment before God.</hi> For <hi>Elohim</hi> (the Word here for <hi>God</hi>) in the Hebrew Language ſignifies a <hi>Judge.</hi> As in the place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <hi>1 Sam. XXVIII. 9.</hi> There is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence not much unlike to this, I have obſerved in <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Conſolatory Diſcourſe to <hi>Apollonius</hi> upon the death of his Son: where he alledges, amongſt a great many other, this Saying of <hi>Epicharmus,</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> And now, having thus demonſtrated his firſt Propoſition, he elegantly repeats the <hi>Exordium</hi> or entrance of his Book, as is here obſerved by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> whoſe Words are ſo ſignificant, that I cannot but tranſlate them; as an excellent Gloſs upon this Verſe: <hi>For ſince all the labour of mortal man</hi> (<hi>of which</hi> Solomon <hi>hath diſputed in this whole Book) amounts to this, That the Duſt returns to its Earth, and the Soul returns thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence it was taken: it is an exceſs of vanity to labour for this world; and to gather nothing for the future:</hi> where he is to live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to be judged according to his behaviour here.</p>
                     <p>This only may be added, That here he enters upon the Concluſion of his Diſcourſe; and divides it into <hi>two</hi> Parts, as he had done the foregoing Book. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſumms up what he had ſaid in the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt Chapters, concerning the <hi>falſe ways</hi> men take to happineſs, in this Verſe: which he backs by ſeveral ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46873:129"/>in thoſe that fol ow, unto Verſe <hi>13.</hi> Where <hi>ſecondly</hi> he ſumms up what he hath ſaid from Chap. VII. to this place, concerning the <hi>true way</hi> to happineſs; which lies only in a due regard to God and his Commandments.</p>

                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> The firſt Word of this Verſe is variouſly tranſlated: and the whole Verſe applied by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, either to confirm what was ſaid before, concerning the falſe methods men take to happineſs (as if he had ſaid, I have done when I have told you, that you may believe me; who am ſufficiently able to inform you, and not think to meet with better information, from other mens Writings, or from your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) or as an introduction to what he intends to ſay, ver <hi>13, 14.</hi> concerning the right method to be happy. Which he prepares the Reader to attend unto, and receive into his mind; firſt, by aſſerting his own great Authority in this Verſe (who the wiſer he was, the more deſirous he was both to teach, and to learn) And then, the weighty Doctrine which he taught, v. <hi>10.</hi> And the great uſefulneſs of it, v. <hi>11.</hi> The like to which they would find no where elſe, v. <hi>12.</hi> It is not very material which of theſe ways we take; but I have had reſpect to both, in my Paraphraſe: where I have expreſſed the ſenſe ſo fully, that I cannot think fit to enlarge any further upon this Verſe. But only note, that <hi>Luther,</hi> and he alone I think, expounds the firſt Words thus (not abſurdly, nor diſagreeing with the Hebrew Text) <hi>There remained nothing to the Preacher, but that he was wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46873:129"/>meet with deſirable words; and the writing of uprightneſs; and the words of truth.</hi> Where <hi>writing</hi> may refer both to what he read in others, whether Divine or Humane Authors; and to what he wrote himſelf (and ſo I have expounded it in the Paraphraſe) which he commends from three Heads, <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or delight; <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> and <hi>certainty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some fanſie that <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote a Book called <hi>Catub Jaſcher</hi> (the Writing of Uprightneſs) or <hi>Jaſcher dibre emeth</hi> (the upright Words of Truth) of which, as there is no certainty, ſo I ſee no probable grounds to aſſert it. Only we know he wrote a great many more Books than we have, <hi>1 King. IV. 32, 33. 2 Chron. XXXV. 4.</hi> And ſee <hi>Joſephus</hi> L. VIII. Antiq. C. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> Some connect this with the foregoing Verſe in this manner, <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out the words of the Wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo the Words run exactly in the Hebrew. But we may take this Verſe by it ſelf, ſupplying the Word <hi>are,</hi> as we do in our Tranſlation; and look upon it as a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe wiſe Words: which doth not in the leaſt alter the ſenſe. I have had reſpect to both; and comprehended alſo, in my Paraphraſe, two of the Interpretations, which one difficult Phraſe is capable of, viz. <hi>Maſters of the Aſſemblies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which may be tranſlated divers ways, more literally out of the Hebrew than we do; who add the Word <hi>by</hi> before them, which is not in the Original. For the laſt Words, which we tranſlate <hi>Maſters of Aſſemblies,</hi> may be attributed to <hi>Nails,</hi> in this manner: <hi>As Nails faſtened, whereby things are joined together,</hi> (<hi>Nails</hi> being the Inſtruments of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or bringing thoſe things together, which were ſeparate) or thus, retaining the Words of our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>the Maſters of Aſſemblies are as fixed Nails:</hi> or the <hi>Maſters of Collections,</hi> ſuch judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46873:130"/>Authors as make excellent Collections of Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms and ſmart Sayings, <hi>Stick in the Mind as Nails do in Planks.</hi> Or the <hi>Principal,</hi> the choice <hi>Collections</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of Wiſe men, mentioned in the beginning of the Verſe) <hi>are as,</hi> &amp;c. or it may, in the ſame ſenſe, be connected (not with Nails, but) with the Words following: the <hi>Maſters</hi> or <hi>Authors that collect wiſe and pithy Sayings, have their Gifts from one and the ſame Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So ungrounded is the fancy of <hi>Grotius;</hi> who from hence conjectures, that there were ſeveral perſons appointed by <hi>Zerobbabel</hi> (whom he takes for this <hi>one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi>) to collect the Sentences of this Book, and put them out under the name of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Who himſelf may rather be thought to be this <hi>one Paſtor</hi> or <hi>King:</hi> who employed (if we interpret the Words this way) many perſons to make Collections: of which he afterwards made uſe as he ſaw cauſe.</p>
                     <p>This ſeems to be certain, that he here gives the reaſon of this conciſe and ſententious way of Writing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch acute Sayings, not only ſtir up and quicken ſlothful minds for the preſent (as a Goad ſtimulates the dull Oxe to labour) but penetrate deep and ſtick faſt in the memory; collecting alſo the thoughts, affections and reſolutions, to one certain Point or Scope; and gathering together a great deal of ſenſe into a few Words. As thoſe Words <hi>baale a ſyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poth,</hi> Maſters of Aſſemblies, or Authors of Collections may, I have ſometimes thought, be underſtood. Such a Collector was that Great Man <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> who gathered a Book of Apoththegms; and ſhowed by that, he thought it more honourable unto him, if he changed himſelf, as it were, into <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicils,</hi> in which the prudent and grave Sayings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were regiſtred; than to have his own Words hallowed like Oracles, as ſome vain Princes, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46873:130"/>by flattery, have affected. Though divers of his own Speeches, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves (L. I. <hi>de Augm. Scient.</hi> C. <hi>7.</hi>) are truly ſuch as thoſe which <hi>Solomon</hi> here deſcribes, full of vigour and efficacy: inſomuch, that by one word alone he appeaſed a mutiny in his Army.</p>
                     <p>But, after all that may be ſaid on this Subject, ſince I find not only the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> but the LXX making out the ſenſe by adding the Word <hi>per</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as we do the Word <hi>by</hi> in our Tranſlation) before <hi>Maſters of Aſſemblies;</hi> I have in the Paraphraſe followed that Interpretation alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> And in this Verſe have adhered to the ſame Tranſlation, which underſtands the firſt Words, as if he had ſaid: Beyond theſe things do not trouble thy ſelf. For ſo they may be tranſlated exactly, <hi>and what is above, or more than them</hi> (that is, the <hi>the words of the wiſe,</hi> beforementioned) <hi>my Son, be warned, or be enlightned:</hi> obſerve theſe well, and trouble thy ſelf no further. Be content with a few good Precepts of the Wiſe; and do not involve thy ſelf in many Books. For what is neceſſary may be learnt without much labour, out of a ſhort Book: if men will be wiſer than they need they will but trouble themſelves to no purpoſe. There being no certainty of moſt things; no ſatisfaction when we go beyond the known and acknowledged Principle, and Precepts of Vertue: but what one man aſſerts, another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes; and when we think we have written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, another Writer ſtarts up and diſcovers abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of errours; and ſo Volumes are multiplied without end: and we are led into long diſquiſitions, without any ſatisfaction to the mind, but with much wearineſs to the Body, and great loſs of precious time; which had better be ſpent in digeſting and practiſing, ſuch ſhort, uſeful, and neceſſary Inſtructions as theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:46873:131"/>
He doth not abſolutely condemn many Books, for there are not a few of the Divine Writings; and about the ſame thing: but Books about needleſs things; and that dilate too much upon things neceſſary; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tiring, than inſtructing. And he condemns the levity of thoſe that are always reading, but never meditating: running over ſuch a Book as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and then going to another, not ſo profitable; and never returning to this again.</p>
                     <p>So I take it in ſhort, <hi>Content thy ſelf with this Book, and ſuch like; and do not turn over many Authors, to learn how to be happy.</hi> For goodneſs and truth are included in certain Bounds; but wickedneſs and lyes, <hi>ſine fine ſunt,</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> here notes. Who obſerves alſo, that perhaps he adviſeth us, to ſtudy brevity; and to mind the ſenſe more than the words: directly contrary to the Philoſophers and Doctors of the World, who to aſſert their falſe Opinions, uſe abundance and great variety of Words; but the Divine Scripture, <hi>brevi Circulo coarctata eſt,</hi> is confined to a ſmall Circle; and as much contracted in Words, as it is dilated in ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrew Word <hi>bahag,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>ſtudy, Aben Ezra</hi> ſays, in the neighbouring Languages, ſignifies <hi>reading;</hi> and ſo we tranſlate it in the Margin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> To teach us to contract our labours into as ſmall a compaſs as we can, he ſumms up, in a few Words, the ſenſe of his whole Diſcourſe in this Book; which he calls <hi>the concluſion or end of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> of all that can be ſaid on this Subject: the whole ſenſe of the Sermon, ſuccinctly delivered; unto which therefore every one ſhould confine his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. It is this, to work his Soul unto ſuch a due regard of the Divine Majeſty (ſtanding in awe of him as his Lord, Overſeer and Judge) that he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46873:131"/>take care to obſerve all his Commandments: without which all Religion is vain and fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>And theſe two things (the <hi>fear of God</hi> (or devotion) and <hi>obedience</hi>) he commends from <hi>two</hi> Arguments. The <hi>firſt</hi> of which is in this Verſe; that they are things, which concern all Mankind, one as well as another; of which if they be careful, they have done enough to make themſelves immortally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe Words, <hi>this is the whole,</hi> or <hi>the all of man,</hi> may be expounded four ſeveral ways: either this is <hi>all the duty of man,</hi> or the <hi>duty of all men;</hi> or the <hi>whole happineſs of all men;</hi> or <hi>their whole buſineſs;</hi> unto which therefore they ſhould devote their <hi>whole ſelves;</hi> that is, all their ſtrength. For according as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it, <hi>to this Man was born: that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God is his Creator, ſhould worſhip him with fear, and honour and obſervance of his Commands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>fear of God</hi> being implanted in our minds, we ſhall not fail to worſhip Him, and call upon Him, and expect all good things from Him, and give Him thanks for them: And, as the beſt expreſſion of our thankfulneſs, <hi>keep his Commandments,</hi> and be obedient to all his Precepts: both in ſubduing our ſinful Appetites and Paſſions, and in exerciſing Charity towards our Neighbours. Which will make us true in word and deed; faithful in all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; liberal to the Poor; obſervant of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; in ſhort, make us obſerve all the directions of this Book, in order to our happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14.]</hi> Here is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument, why we ſhould ſeriouſly intend theſe things; becauſe the Lord and Judge of the World, will one day call us to an account for what we do here; and paſs an impartial Sentence upon every action of our life, even
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46873:132"/>
                        <hi>againſt every Secret</hi> (as ſome expound theſe Words <hi>al col alam</hi>) or upon all ſecret as well as open acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Which are all known to Him, though now He ſeem to take no notice of them; and ſhall then not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought to light, but with an apparent diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between good and evil: the difference of which, ſhall be certainly and notoriouſly manifeſted; by the ſevere puniſhment of the one, and the bountiful remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the other.</p>
                     <p>I will imitate therefore (ſaith <hi>Melancthon</hi>) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and in the Concluſion recite the ſumm of this Book. <q>He intended to aſſert Divine Providence; and to refute the Objections againſt it. which are theſe; There are great confuſions in humane life; a vaſt multitude of ungodly men, and but few that acknowledge, and fear God: and, which is worſe, the wicked flouriſh in honour and riches; but the pious are afflicted, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times killed by the worſt of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore all things ſeem to be carried by Chance. Unto which <hi>Solomon</hi> anſwers: Tho' for the moſt part, ſuch be the confuſion of things, yet be thou ruled by God's Word; and hold the Opinion of his Providence with a firm Faith. Do not fall from God, becauſe of theſe Scandals; nor caſt away his fear, or thy confidence in Him; nor deſert thy vocation: but oppoſe theſe <hi>two</hi> things to theſe confuſions; There will come a Judgment, when God will take away theſe confuſions and make an exact diſtinction: for the wicked ſhall be thrown into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it ſhall be well for ever with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And in this life alſo, God moderates theſe confuſions: for he puniſhes heinous wickedneſs; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Government, preſerves Governours, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Polities in the World. Nay, this is a teſtimony of God's preſence, that when the infirmity of humane Nature is ſo great, and ſo many are no
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46873:132"/>better than mad and furious; yet God preſerves his Church: and, I may add, we have ſuch good Books as theſe for our direction into Truth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in Piety.</q>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THat this Book was compoſed by <hi>SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON</hi> is no more doubted, than that he was the Author of the two foregoing.</p>
                  <p>And that it was always lookt upon as an Holy Book, treating of ſome Spiritual and Divine matter, appears from its being placed among the reſt of that kind. Nor hath it been doubted of by any conſiderable number of men, either among Jews or Chriſtians, but only by a few ſingular perſons; who ought (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks in his Preface to this Book) to have lookt upon thoſe bleſſed Fathers, who placing this Song among the Divine Writings, took it to be fit for the uſes of the Church, as men of greater judgment, and more ſpiritual than themſelves. And they ought likewiſe to have conſidered (as he adds) that we have, in effect, the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt it ſelf, for its. Divine Authority: <hi>Ezra,</hi> a man excelling in Vertue and full of the Holy Spirit, having thought this worthy of a room among thoſe Sacred Volumes, which he gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after their return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly, a great many holy men have illuſtrated it (as he further notes) with their
<pb facs="tcp:46873:135"/>Commentaries and Interpretations, or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned their Writings with its Sentences: ſuch as <hi>Euſebius, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> (who wore the Crown of Martyrdom) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and others that were more ancient than theſe, and nearer to the times of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to mention thoſe that followed after in future times, who all took this for a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Book: let us only conſider, whether theſe things being ſo, it be reaſonable for us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ſo many and ſuch great perſons, nay the Holy Spirit it ſelf, and to follow our own private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; nor hearkning to him that ſaid, <hi>The thoughts of mortal man are vain, and our devices are but uncertain, IX. Wiſd. 14.</hi> or rather of St. <hi>Paul, I. Rom. 21. They became vain in their imagination, and their fooliſh heart was darkened.</hi>

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> Nor doth it ſeem hard, either to find out what that ſpiritual matter is, of which the Wiſe man here treats (eſpecially, ſince all Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have from the beginning applied this Song to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi>) or to give an account of the riſe and Original of ſuch ſublime contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations: which I take to be this.</p>
                  <p>The great Prophet <hi>David</hi> having plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that a far more glorious King than his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhould one day ariſe (as we read in the Song he made at his Marriage, <hi>Pſal. XLV.</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:46873:135"/>and likewiſe more expreſly propheſied of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, Royal Majeſty, Prieſthood, &amp;c. <hi>(Pſal. CX.)</hi> and again reſumed this Argument, juſt before his death, when he cauſed his Son <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to be crowned and to ſit upon his Throne <hi>(Pſal. LXXII.)</hi> it ſtirred up the longing deſires of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> after the coming of this moſt illuſtrious Prince; and made him ſtudy to have, at leaſt, as clear a ſight of Him, as was poſſible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, afar off. And that he might ſtir up the ſame deſire in the whole Nation, after his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he caſt his Meditations on this Subject into a Song, in the form of a <hi>Paſtoral Eclogue:</hi> In which ſeveral perſons being introduced who ſpeak their Parts, it may be called a <hi>Dramatick Poem.</hi> And ſo it is ſtiled by S. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> in his XXXI. Oration; where he quotes a paſſage, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as his Words are <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 503. Edit. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ.</note>) out of this Bridal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude and <hi>Song.</hi> For a <hi>Drama,</hi> as the Greeks teach us, conſiſts in the change of perſons: ſome of which enter; others come to them; others withdraw; till the whole Work be completed, by this ſhifting and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Now the Perſons which compoſe this Song, are the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Virgins</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on her, and the <hi>Youths</hi> attending on him: to whom ſome add the <hi>Siſter</hi> of the Spouſe mentioned Chap. VIII; and the <hi>Watchmen</hi> and <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> who are introduced in their turns. For example, firſt, the Bride,
<pb facs="tcp:46873:136"/>and her Companions, comes in and ſaith, <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Then the Bridegroom appears, and ſaith, v. <hi>8. If thou knoweſt not, O thou faireſt,</hi> &amp;c. After which he ſeems to withdraw himſelf, leaving the Bride and her Companions alone upon the Stage (while he ſits at his repaſt, v. <hi>12.</hi>) who thus ſpeak to her, <hi>We will make the Borders of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. And then ſhe ſpeaks again, v. <hi>13.</hi> and he returns and ſpeaks, v. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many Parts there are in this <hi>Drama,</hi> is not agreed. Some make <hi>ten;</hi> others make but <hi>ſeven Colloquies,</hi> or interlocutory paſſages, in this ſacred <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as they call it. About which I do not think fit to diſpute; but ſhall take notice of as many as I can obſerve, in the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Annotations</hi> upon each Chapter.</p>
                  <p>As for the Phraſe, it is wholly Allegorical, in expreſſions borrowed chiefly from the Fields and Woods and Gardens: as I ſhall ſhow in their proper places, when we meet with them. And ſuch were the fitteſt that could be found, ſuppoſing he would uſe Poetical Words; to ſet forth the ardent deſire he had, and would excite in others (as I ſaid before) to have a ſight of that great <hi>Shepherd</hi> of the Sheep, who would make all the World happy.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> And none need wonder that he ſpeaks <hi>wholly</hi> of this glorious King; for ſo doth his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the CXth. Pſalm, which can be applied to
<pb facs="tcp:46873:136"/>no other perſon whatſoever: and ſo doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in after-times, in his LIII. Chapter. Which though ſome have endeavoured to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate firſt to another perſon, yet they have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their attempt; and never could find any in whom it was ſo literally fulfilled as in our Bleſſed Saviour. Who alone was there intended; as He ſeems to me to be here alſo, in this preſent Song of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>Where it need not ſeem ſtrange neither to any one, that he is compared to a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and the Church to a <hi>Bride,</hi> who doth but reflect upon the XLV Pſalm; and obſerve how <hi>Solomon</hi> doth only follow the Metaphor, wherein his Father <hi>David</hi> had repreſented this Myſtery: and obſerve withal, that it is the common Language of the Prophets, who compare <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Zion</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which names is comprehended the whole Church of the Jews) to a Virgin, called frequently <hi>the Virgin-Daughter of Sion,</hi> &amp;c. whom God had eſpouſed unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> But, for the fuller Explication of this, it may be fit to note, that the profoundeſt of the Hebrew Divines, whom they now call <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> having ſuch a Notion as this among them, that <hi>ſenſible things are but an imitation of things above,</hi> conceived from thence, that there was (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) an Original pattern of that love and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is between a Man and his Wife here in this World This they expreſſed by the kindneſs
<pb facs="tcp:46873:137"/>of <hi>Tipheret</hi> to <hi>Malcuth:</hi> which are the Names they give unto the inviſible Bridegroom and Bride in the upper World. And this <hi>Tipheret</hi> (i.e. <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Ornament</hi>) they call alſo by the Name of the <hi>Adam on high,</hi> and the <hi>Great Adam,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>terreſtrial</hi> or <hi>little Adam</hi> here below. As <hi>Malcuth</hi> (i. e. Kingdom) they call alſo by the name of <hi>Cheneſeth Iſrael,</hi> i. e.

So that, in ſumm, they ſeem to ſay the ſame that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth, when he tells us, that <hi>Marriage is a great Myſtery; but he ſpeaks concerning Chriſt and his Church, V. Epheſ. 32.</hi> For the Marriage of <hi>Tipheret</hi> and <hi>Malcuth</hi> (or <hi>Cheneſeth Iſrael</hi>) is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chriſt, the Lord, from Heaven, with his Spouſe the Church, which is the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian people. Which was repreſented in the conjunction of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and of all other men and women deſcended from them, when they are joined together in holy Matrimony; inſomuch that thoſe Divines, called <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> have formed this Maxim about this matter; that <hi>whereſoever in the Scripture we read of the love of Man and Wife, there is my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically

                  <p>Now if this Notion (of which the Learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath long ago wrote a peculiar Diſcourſe) was ſo ancient among thoſe Doctors, that they had it before the times of Chriſt; it gives the plaineſt account, why <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> uſes the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> as if they were in a manner ſynonymous, and of the ſame import, <hi>III. Joh. 28, 29.</hi> and why Chriſt himſelf compares the whole buſineſs of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom (called by the people in St. <hi>Mark XI. 10. the Kingdom of our Father David</hi>) to a <hi>Marriage,</hi> or <hi>Marriage-feaſt,</hi> which a King made for his Son, <hi>Matth.

And ſo he taught the Children of Iſrael to do, by uſing this form of Speech throughout the whole Prophetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>LIV. Iſai. 5. LXII. 4, 5. III. Jerem. 4.20. XXXI. 32. II. Hoſea 2, 7.</hi> and many other places. Nay, the very Words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſeem to ſuppoſe ſome ſuch myſtical ſenſe, which was current in
<pb facs="tcp:46873:138"/>that Nation, of thoſe Words of <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, <hi>II. Geneſ. 23, 24. This now is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore ſhall a man leave his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſhall cleave unto his wife; and they ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Which the Apoſtle takes, as if they had been ſpoken of Chriſt, and his love to his Church, as any one may ſee that will read <hi>V. Epheſ. 29, 30, 31, 32.</hi> For theſe are not in the account of the <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> two diſtinct ſenſes: but one and the ſame ſenſe, different only as the matter and the form of the ſame thing: which form, ſay they, lies latent under the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby we are led unto it, as the main thing comprehended in it.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Archangelus Burgonovenſis</hi> ſpeaks, in his Preface to the Explication of ſome ſelect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms of thoſe Divines, <hi>gathered by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula,</hi> who obſerves alſo (p. <hi>91.</hi> of his Book) that as immediately after the Fabrick of the World was reared, Matrimony followed, as the Emblem of God's great love to thoſe that ſhould believe on Him; ſo this World ſhall end in the Sacrament of Marriage: St. <hi>John</hi> ſhutting up all the Myſteries of the holy Scripture in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> with theſe Words, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready, XIX. Rev. 7.</hi> Which, if it be the voice of the heavenly Hoſt, agrees with what the Hebrew Doctors ſay (in <hi>Perke Elieſer,</hi> Cap. <hi>12.</hi>) of the Marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> that <hi>the Angels
<pb facs="tcp:46873:138"/>rejoyced at it, and with muſick and dancing attended upon the Wedding.</hi>

                     <hi>VI.</hi> All which things put together ſhow how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the thoughts of <hi>David</hi> were led, at <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Marriage, to ſing concerning Chriſt and his Church; and the thoughts of <hi>Solomon</hi> afterward to ſing more largely of the wonderful love of the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bridegroom, in this <hi>Song of Songs;</hi> that is, moſt excellent Song. For ſo it may be truly called both in regard of its Subject matter; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of its compoſure: this Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical way of writing, by Figures and Similitudes, being in many regards (as the forenamed <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtical</hi> Doctors diſcourſe) the beſt of all others. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is taken from things ſenſible, by which both learned men and ignorant may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe ſuch Narrations very eaſily imprint themſelves on the mind: a Parable (ſay they) being inſtead of an artificial Memory. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> becauſe all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath its riſe from ſenſe, and therefore ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizes much with ſenſible Parables. And <hi>fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it is very delightful to contemplate how the Parable agrees with the ſpiritual things, which are thereby figured. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which (ſaith that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changelus</hi> before-mentioned) the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is conformable, when he ſaith, <hi>The inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God from the creation of the World, are ſeen by thoſe that are made,</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> what is there more evident, than
<pb facs="tcp:46873:139"/>that all viſible things declare God to be love? whoſe praiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> celebrates in this Song. For by love, (as the ſame Author diſcourſes out of <hi>Boetius</hi> and others) the Heavens are joyned together, and the Elements agree in compoſition, Animals cohabit, Cities are preſerved, and all Kingdoms ſupported and repleniſhed. Which made <hi>Pherecydes Syrus</hi> ſay, that God was transformed into love, before He made the World. And becauſe God created all things in love, he alſo embraces all things with the ſame love; and would have us to love; which is the ſumm of all that He exacts of us: that being knit together by mutual love, we may in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be united with Him in love; that ſo all things may be one, as they were in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Of this love, <hi>Solomon</hi> (ſay they) treats throughout this whole Song; nay, it is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the Book of God. According to that of <hi>David, LXII. Pſal. 11, 12. God hath ſpoken once,</hi> viz. to the whole people of Iſrael, when he gave the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> yea, <hi>twice have I heard this,</hi> from the Prophets, that is, who ſay the ſame with the Law, <hi>that power belongeth to God, alſo unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou rendereſt to every man according to his work.</hi> Which they expound in this manner, Thou canſt ſend good or evil influences upon us; by the union of <hi>Tipheret</hi> and <hi>Malcuth,</hi> a good influence; by their ſeparation, a bad. For when <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth well, then it receives good influences from above;
<pb facs="tcp:46873:139"/>that is, from <hi>Tipheret:</hi> for <hi>ſuch is the order</hi> (ſays one of their Aphoriſms) <hi>which is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Archetypal World, that all good influences proceed from Tipheret.</hi> And then theſe two Principles are united, when we obſerve God's Precepts; but when we tranſgreſs the Law, the one is ſeparated from the other; that is, <hi>Tipheret</hi> doth not ſend influences upon <hi>Malcuth</hi> for our good; but another Principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes and ſends anxiety and trouble. Now Love is the union of theſe two Principles: the love of Man and Wife ſignifying in Scripture the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Tipheret:</hi> which <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>II. 19, 20. I will betroth me unto thee for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercies: I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus that ſort of Divines diſcourſe; very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the ſenſe of this Book. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Heavenly <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> appearing in the greateſt <hi>Beauty;</hi> and ſometimes in moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar communication with his Spouſe the Church: but at other times withdrawing his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and abſenting himſelf from her. Who is repreſented therefore after the ſame manner, like to the moon (unto which they compare <hi>Malcuth</hi>) ſometimes full of his heavenly light, ſometimes illuminated only in part, and ſometimes obſcure and dark. Which will appear more at large, in the Explication of the ſeveral parts of this Book.</p>

                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1. Song of Songs]</hi> every one knows is an Hebraiſm for the moſt <hi>excellent Song;</hi> as <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> is the <hi>moſt Holy;</hi> and <hi>King of Kings,</hi> the <hi>greateſt King.</hi> And though the moſt natural meaning ſeems to be, that this is the moſt excellent of all the Songs that <hi>Solomon</hi> made, (which were very many, <hi>1 King. IV. 32.</hi>) both in its ſtructure and compoſure, and in regard of the Subject whereof it treats, yet ſince the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, and abundance of Chriſtian Writers, think it called the moſt excellent Song, with reſpect likewiſe to all the Songs that had been formerly made by any Prophetical perſon, as thoſe, <hi>XV. Exod. V. Judg. 1 Sam. II.</hi> &amp;c. (becauſe <hi>they</hi> celebrated only ſome particular benefits, <hi>this</hi> the immenſe love of God, not only towards that Nation, but towards all mankind) I have not neglected that in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>which is Solomons]</hi> The Hebrew Words are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that they may either ſignifie <hi>concerning So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (i. e. Chriſt) or of which <hi>Solomon was the Author.</hi> Which, I doubt not, is the firſt and literal meaning; becauſe ſo the LXX expound it; and ſo the ſame Phraſe is underſtood by all, in the Titles of thoſe Pſalms, which are called <hi>Pſalms of David.</hi> But it may be obſerved further, that here
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46873:145"/>are none of his uſual Titles added, as there are in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtes;</hi> where he is called <hi>Son of David, King of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>King in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Of which if any reaſon is to be aſſigned, this ſeems the moſt probable, that thoſe Titles, which have reſpect only to his temporal eſtate, greatneſs and dignity, he wholly forgot, when he was rapt in contemplation of that Celeſtial Prince, the Prince of peace; in compariſon with whom all others are not worth the naming; and whoſe Character was beſt expreſſed by the name of <hi>Solomon</hi> alone: He being the great <hi>Peace-maker</hi> and Reconciler of God and man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2. Let him kiſs me] Solomon</hi> ſpeaks this in the perſon of the <hi>Virgin Daughter of Sion;</hi> that is the Church. Whom he here introduces in the moſt paſſionate ſtrain, wiſhing for ſome token of love, which is expreſſed under the Metaphor of a <hi>kiſs.</hi> But there is no mention at all made of the Name, condition, or beauty of the Perſon whoſe love is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; nor any account given of the beginning or progreſs of this deſire: but he makes her burſt out on a ſudden, and abruptly into theſe Words, <hi>Let him kiſs me,</hi> &amp;c. that he might the more artificially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the nature and force of Divine love: Which, when it poſſeſſes the mind, ſnatches it ſo from it ſelf, that it is wholly in him that it loves. It thinks of nothing elſe, ſeeks nothing, wiſhes nothing, ſpeaks of nothing but this alone: and imagins that every Body elſe thinks of the ſame, and knows of whom it ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>It is juſt ſuch a beginning as that of the <hi>LXXXVIIth. Pſalm:</hi> where the Pſalmiſt enters upon the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lovelineſs of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> in this manner, <hi>His foundation is in the holy Mountains.</hi>

Luke 45.</hi>) ſo many <hi>kiſſes</hi> were a token of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant love, and exceſſive affection; as appears from what is there ſaid by our Saviour of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had <hi>not ceaſed to kiſs his very feet.</hi> And therefore the beginning of this Verſe may be thus paraphraſed, <hi>Let Him declare his love unto me, in the moſt familiar and moſt ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

                        <hi>better than wine] Wine</hi> was the higheſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe Gueſts before-mentioned; and therefore uſed by the Hebrews to expreſs the greateſt pleaſure. There was a portion of it alſo to be poured out on the Altar, in their Offerings to God: and ſo may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their Sacrifices, which were the principal part of their Religion.

This came into my mind ſince I wrote the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, and ſeems to be the plaineſt account of this Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5. I am black,</hi> &amp;c.] The principal Myſtery of the Kingdom of Chriſt, being the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles into fellowſhip with Him (which is oftner called a <hi>Myſtery</hi> in the New Teſtament than any one thing whatſoever) <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of that in this Verſe: having beheld, in the rapture wherein he was, the Gentiles flocking to Him, not without the great diſpleaſure of the Jews. Who contemned, and would have excluded them, as people uncapable of his love: unto which the Gentiles are here introduced, making their Anſwer to the Exceptions of the Jews, in theſe Words: <hi>I am black, but comely,</hi> &amp;c. The literal ſenſe of which, and of the next Verſe, I have expreſſed ſo fully in the Paraphraſe, annexing the ſpiritual ſenſe at the end, that I do not think fit to enlarge upon it here. But deſire the Reader to take notice, that the Word <hi>Sechora,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>black,</hi> denotes ſuch a duskiſhneſs as is in the <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> (called <hi>Sechar</hi> in the Hebrew) when ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle light begins to appear, and the darkneſs to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Which aptly repreſents the condition of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World, when they were upon the point of receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge of Chriſt. Which this wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> might well foreſee would be imparted to them; by obſerving a Type of it in his own Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as well as in the Marriages of other Great Men in former times. Which plainly ſhowed the Jews, if they would have learnt it, that there was no reaſon they ſhould except againſt the conjunction of the Gentiles with themſelves; in the ſpiritual Marriage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46873:147"/>of both, in one body, unto Chriſt. For <hi>Iſaac</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Rebecca</hi> a Gentile, and the Daughter of an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, as appears from her Brother <hi>Laban,</hi> who was no better, <hi>XXXI. Gen. 19, 30,</hi> &amp;c. And this mans Daughters <hi>Jacob</hi> married: whoſe Son <hi>Judah,</hi> the Prince of their Tribes, took to Wife a <hi>Canaanite (XXXVIII. Gen. 2.)</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did an <hi>Egyptian (XLI. Gen. 45.)</hi> nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, their great Deliverer and Law-giver, married an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> (or <hi>Arabian</hi>) Woman <hi>(XII. Numb. 1.)</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the anger of his Brother and Siſter at this Marriage, would not be divorced from her. <hi>Naaſſon</hi> alſo, a Great Man of the houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> married <hi>Rahab</hi> of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and had by her <hi>Booz:</hi> who took <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs</hi> to Wife, by whom he had <hi>Obed</hi> the Grandfather of <hi>David.</hi> And indeed, the very firſt Inſtitution of Marriage having (as I have proved in the Preface) a myſtical intention in it, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> unfolds in the <hi>V. Epheſ.</hi> theſe Marriages may well be lookt upon as Emblems of the uniting all ſorts of people with Chriſt, in one Body of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> Here they ſeem to give an account how they came to degenerate, and loſe their Original Beauty; by falſe Prophets and Propheteſſes, in the Gentile World, who led them to Idolatry: particularly to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Sun, which was the moſt ancient of all other <hi>IV. Deut. 19. XXXI. Job 26.</hi>) and ſpread it ſelf as far as the Sun ſhineth. For it was the Sun whom one Country worſhipped under the name of <hi>Baal;</hi> another under the name of <hi>Moloch;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Chemoſh;</hi> and others of <hi>Mithras</hi> and <hi>Oſyris.</hi> Which laſt was the name given to it by the Egyptians: among whom the Sun was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the famous City of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> (which took its name from thence) not far from the Land of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes;</hi> where the Children of Iſrael dwelt while
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46873:148"/>they lived there, <hi>XLVII. Gen. 11.</hi> and ſo were more eaſily infected with that Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> This Verſe I take to be the voice of the whole Church, longing to be acquainted with his Doctrine; which is compared to <hi>food,</hi> as his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are to <hi>Sheep:</hi> Whom Shepherds were wont, in thoſe Countries, to lead into cool Shades at Noon, that they might not ſuffer by the heat. Unto which <hi>Solomon</hi> here alludes; repreſenting all pious Souls as afraid alſo of wandring from the true Shepherd, and falling, like Sheep that go aſtray, into the hands of Strangers. All which Metaphors are largely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by our Bleſſed Saviour, in one of his Parables <hi>(X. John)</hi> as compariſons familiarly known to his Diſciples; who found them here firſt uſed in this Holy Book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> To the foregoing Petition, He here returns his Anſwer. Which needs no other Explication, than what I have given of it in the Paraphraſe: unleſs we obſerve a difference between <hi>Flocks</hi> and <hi>Kids.</hi> The latter of Which ſignifies the <hi>Goats young ones;</hi> and ſo may repreſent the new Converts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who formerly lay under an ill Character, and did <hi>male olere,</hi> as they ſpeak, ſmell rank of many foul Superſtitions. But I am not willing to meddle with ſuch niceties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9. company of horſes,</hi> &amp;c.] This Compariſon may convince us, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not aim at any ſingle perſon in this Song (either <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, or a beautiful <hi>Shunamire,</hi> or any other Woman or Virgin, who would very abſurdly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Troop of Horſes</hi>) but at a great many united in a Body: <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole Company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Meſſiah; who may very fitly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the <hi>Horſes in the Chariots of Pharaoh.</hi> Whoſe Kingdom, in thoſe days, abounded with the moſt excellent Horſes: which were famous for their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46873:148"/>ſtrength, and fitneſs for ſervice: as may be ſeen by the proviſion of them <hi>Solomon</hi> made for himſelf from thence, <hi>1 King. X. 28, 29;</hi> and the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which came from thence againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his Sons days, <hi>2 Chron. XII. 3.</hi> Long after which, we read of their great force, <hi>XXXI. Iſai. 1. XLVI. Jer. 4, 9.</hi> and conſequently, the Body of Chriſtian people, that is the Church, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a company of them, is ſet forth thereby as very powerful, and prevailing over all Oppoſers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10]</hi> The means of which, is here repreſented to be by the power of the Spirit; wherewith Chriſt hath endued his Church. For the manner of Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms being to preſent their future Bride, with Jewels, or ſome other rich Gifts (ſuitable to their quality and ability) <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes to them, as I take it, in this Verſe; and points at the Gifts which his Father foretold <hi>(LXVIII. Pſal. 18.)</hi> Chriſt would diſpenſe, when he aſcended up on high to his Throne of Glory: whereby ſeveral Orders of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men were conſtituted in the Church, <hi>1 Corinth. XII. 28, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> And the deſign of all thoſe Gifts, was to make men truly vertuous, which ſeems to be intended in this Verſe (for love and good works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Gold</hi> in the language of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>III. Revel. 18.</hi>) which is the voice of all thoſe that attended upon the Bride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> That which makes the greateſt difficulty in this Book, is the frequent change of the perſons that ſpeak: and it is doubted here, whoſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage this is. I take it to be the Bride her ſelf, that here again gratefully acknowledges his benefits, and endeavours to make all the World ſenſible of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ſitteth at his Tablt]</hi> The King ſitting at his Table, ſignifying his reſt and joy after all his labours; I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46873:149"/>have therefore expounded it of the Throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: unto which our Bleſſed Saviour being advanced, He received power to prefer others; whoſe honour and dignity is expreſſed by theſe two things, <hi>eating at his Table,</hi> and <hi>ſitting by him upon Thrones;</hi> which was the ſame thing in our Saviours own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>XIX. Matth. 28.</hi> compared with <hi>XXII. Luke 29, 30.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spikenard]</hi> It is obſerved by <hi>Pliny</hi> that the moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant <hi>Nard</hi> comes from the <hi>Spikes</hi> of a very ſmall contemptible Shrub: which may well be lookt upon as an Emblem of the ſweet odour of the Goſpel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſuch mean and deſpicable perſons, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were of themſelves, filled all the World by their preaching: together with the extraordinary holineſs of their lives, which recommended their preaching very much to all obſerving men. So the <hi>Cabbaliſts</hi> expound this fragrancy in the Ancient Book <hi>Zohar.</hi> Where <hi>R. Juda</hi> ſaith, When good works are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the World, then the <hi>Cheneſeth Iſrael</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Congregation of Iſrael,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuth</hi> in their language) exhales <hi>rich in tovin, good odours,</hi> i. e. moſt ſweet and fragrant odours, being bleſſed by the holy King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Words the Scholiaſt expounds thus, <hi>She exhales ſweet odours to her Husband Tipheret,</hi> and is moſt acceptable to Him: the lower World (as his Words are) being by this means married to the higher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13. a bundle of myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c.] The Church deriving the greateſt comfort and ſatisfaction, from his ſitting on the Throne of his Glory; reſolves here to keep Him perpetually in mind, and in her moſt hearty affections: which is expreſſed by <hi>Myrrhe</hi> tied up in a little Bag, and put into the boſom, as the manner was in thoſe Countries, to corroborate the heart, and exhilarate the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:46873:149"/>
The boſome of all chaſte Women is inacceſſible to any hand, but that of their Husband: and therefore here ſignifies the careful preſervation of his memory; and of the Doctrine he hath depoſited in his Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14. Cluſter of Camphire]</hi> Nothing more puzzles Interpreters, than theſe Words, which we tranſlate <hi>Cluſter of Camphire.</hi> For our <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi> was unknown to the Ancients; and doth not grow in Cluſters, but is the reſinous ſubſtance of a Tree in <hi>Borneo,</hi> and in <hi>China:</hi> And therefore is far better tranſlated in the Margin of our Bibles; <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</hi> But by <hi>Cypreſs</hi> is not to be underſtood the Tree which bears that name among us; but a far more Aromatick Plant in the Eaſt; which was a kind of <hi>Liguſtrum</hi> or <hi>Alcharma;</hi> called by <hi>Pliny, Cyperus,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Cyprus:</hi> which produced a moſt ſweet Buſh of <hi>Flowers,</hi> and alſo <hi>Berries,</hi> not much different from the fragrancy of Spikenard. Whence it is likely the famous Iſland <hi>Cyprus</hi> took its name: becauſe here (as at <hi>Aſcalon</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> and on the Banks of <hi>Nile</hi>) the beſt, that is, the moſt odoriferous <hi>Cyprus</hi> grows. Thus both <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius;</hi> the Iſland <hi>Cyprus</hi> hath its name, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, from the Flower of <hi>Cyprus</hi> growing there: as <hi>Bochart</hi> ſhows in his <hi>Canaan,</hi> L. I. C. <hi>3.</hi> Of which Flowers, or of the Seed, was made that Omtment, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls the <hi>Unguent Royal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is one that thinks theſe Words may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>precious Cluſter,</hi> or <hi>Cluſter of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;</hi> to be bought at any rate: becauſe <hi>Copher</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the price of any thing, that is purchaſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. Such was the Balſam that came from theſe Shrubs: which grew at <hi>Engaddi</hi> (in the Plains of <hi>Jericho</hi>) after the manner of Vines; and therefore called, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath ſhown, the <hi>Vineyards of Engedi.</hi> And thus the ancient Hebrew Doctors,

                        <hi>[r] V. 17. our houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] This laſt Verſe I take for a deſcription of particular Churches: by the <hi>Roof</hi> or <hi>covering</hi> of which I underſtand their protection.

So I have paraphraſed the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Verſe <hi>(his Banner over me was love)</hi> taking in two ſenſes of which the Words are capable. The moſt obvious is that <hi>Love was the Inſcription in his Banner:</hi> the other that <hi>He conquers only by Love;</hi> a Banner diſplayed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing an Armed Force marching under it. <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herrus</hi> in his <hi>Electa,</hi> L. <hi>3.</hi> C. <hi>9.</hi> hath not unfitly gloſſed upon the Words, thus; <q>The Banner of our Lord is his love which he hath publickly declared to us, that He might draw us to Himſelf: by which alſo when we are come to Him, He retains us with Him; and ſtrengthens us by the ſame, when we fight with our ſpiritual Enemies. And that we may alway look upon it and never quail, He carries it over us; that is, renders his love moſt familiar to us. He that knows not this Banner, can be none of his Souldiers; and he that deſerts it, is undone, unleſs he preſently return to it. So that as the <hi>Roman Legions</hi> had their ſeveral names
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46873:155"/>(one of which was called the <hi>Pious,</hi> and another the <hi>Faithful,</hi> another the <hi>Thundring,</hi> another the <hi>Victorious,</hi> &amp;c.) in like manner the Chriſtian Band may be called <hi>Amoris Legio,</hi> the Legion of Love.</q>

Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſmells alſo are wont to be adminiſtred to the Noſe; which is the meaning of calling here for fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant <hi>Apples, Oranges, Citrons,</hi> &amp;c. (as well as Wine) which are all comprehended under the name of <hi>tappuach</hi> in the Hebrew: which is a Word that in its very Original imports an <hi>exhalation,</hi> or <hi>odour-breathing</hi> from that which is ſo called. By all which the Church is repreſented to be ſo marvellouſly affected with the love of Chriſt, as to be even oppreſſed under the weight of Divine Benefits: and at a perfect loſs, what to think of them; having little or nothing to return for ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite obligations.</p>

I go not about to divine what is diſtinctly meant by the <hi>left hand,</hi> and what by the <hi>right</hi> (which I look upon as too great a curioſity in Interpreters) but take them both to expreſs one and the ſame thing.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46873:155"/>I take it to be his; who is the good Shepherd, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in this Paſtoral Song.

And that Word which we well tranſlate <hi>I charge you,</hi> I take to be only a ſolemn form of earneſt beſeeching and entreaty (which all perſons are wont to make by thoſe things that are deareſt to them) not an adjuration, which it is not lawful for any to make, but only by God. I have contented my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this ſimple Paraphraſe of that Paſſage; and ſought for no myſtical Interpretation, as the manner is, which may be found in moſt Interpreters.

                        <hi>[n] V. 14. O my Dove, that art in the Clefts,</hi> &amp;c.] Some of the Hebrew Writers, whoſe ſenſe the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Paraphraſt</hi> expreſſes, refer this to the people of Iſrael flying from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> like a Dove before the Hawk that is ready to ſeize her: but may be better referred to the Church of Chriſt in danger to be torn in pieces by her Pagan Perſecutors, and by the Jews themſelves; as it was in the beginning of our Religion. Which forced Chriſtians to hold their Aſſemblies under ground, in obſcure places (where they ſung Hymns to our Bleſſed Lord before the break of day) and made the Church perfectly like a Dove, who, being in fear of ravenous Birds, flies into Clefts of Rocks, and to ſecret Holes in ſteep places, to preſerve her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Church is ſo often compared by Chriſt to a <hi>Dove</hi> in this Book, that it is fit to give ſome account of it. And <hi>Bochartus de Sacr. Animal.</hi> p. <hi>11.</hi> L. I. C. <hi>4.</hi> takes this to be the principal, if not only reaſon of it; to ſignifie her to be his only Beloved: and that He alone alſo is moſt dear to her. For in <hi>Doves</hi> there is a wonderful love (obſerved by many Authors) between thoſe that are once paired: who never part, but keep faithful the one to the other. And ſo are a fit Emblem of the Church, whom the Apoſtle ſaith he had eſpouſed to Chriſt as a chaſte Virgin, <hi>2 Cor. XI. 2.</hi>

Inſomuch that <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> in his <hi>Equites</hi> compares Souldiers to Foxes; ſpoiling whole Countries, as they do Vineyards. Now the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> comparing falſe Prophets to Foxes, <hi>XIII. 4.</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:46873:157"/>it hath bed all Interpreters (in a manner) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Foxes in this place, <hi>Hereticks:</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very early in the Church, and therefore are compared to <hi>young Foxes:</hi> in regard of their known craft and ſubtilty, windings and turnings, ſhifts and evaſions; whereby the more ſimple ſort eſpecially, and ſuch as were newly converted (compared here to <hi>tender Grapes,</hi> as the Church it ſelf is to a <hi>Vine</hi>) were in danger to be undone, unleſs a timely care was taken to prevent it. And therefore this Verſe ſeems to be an Anſwer to the Churches Prayers, flying to her Lord for refuge. Who ſeeing her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not to be greater from Tyranny, than from falſe Teachers, calls upon his Companions; that is, the Apoſtles, Biſhops, and Paſtors of the Church to look after them, and to take them in their craftineſs. And that whilſt they were <hi>young;</hi> in the beginning, that is, of their appearance in the World: becauſe their <hi>vain bablings were apt to encreaſe to more ungodlineſs, and their words did eat as a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>2</hi> Tim.

If that could not be, then other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſucceeded; and the Apoſtles <hi>delivered up</hi> ſuch dangerous Deceivers <hi>unto Satan</hi> (which was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that included in it bodily affliction) that they might learn not to blaſpheme, <hi>1 Tim.

                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.]</hi> The beginning of this Chapter might be connected with the foregoing, and applied to the State of the Church under affliction; if the following Words would ſute with that Expoſition, which they do not, in my Opinion: For He had deſired to <hi>hear her voice,</hi> v. <hi>14.</hi> of the ſecond Chapter, and now ſhe cannot find Him. Therefore I incline to think, that the very ſame thing is again repreſented in other Words (after the manner of the Prophets; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who over and over again, in ſeveral ſchemes of ſpeech foretels their reſtauration from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and, under that ſhadow, their greater ſalvation by Chriſt) <hi>viz.</hi> the earneſt deſire of the Church for the coming of Chriſt: which <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes by the paſſionate longings he found in himſelf to ſee that bleſſed day.</p>

Of which neither the Temple, nor the Sacrifices, nor the ſacred Books, could diſcover any thing clearly: but was repreſented here to <hi>Solomon</hi> in a Viſion he had of Him, and of the Church which was eſpouſed to Him, after he had ſought a long time, and groped every where after Him, in that dark night wherein they lived. So, as I ſaid, the <hi>night</hi> may be expounded: for ſuch a diſmal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were they in, juſt when He appeared, <hi>IV. Matth. 16. I. Luke 79.</hi>

                        <hi>[c] V. 3. The Watchmen that go about,</hi> &amp;c.] By <hi>Watchmen</hi> I underſtand the Prophets, and ſuch like excellent perſons who inſtructed the people <hi>(III. Ezek. 17. XXXIII. 6, 7.)</hi> of whom he asks, if they <hi>ſaw</hi> Him, whom he ſought after. From which Word I gather that he ſpeaks of ſuch, as were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called <hi>Seers:</hi> of whom he ſaith he was <hi>found;</hi> that is, they ſhowed him ſomething of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> For ſo it follows here in this Verſe, that not long after his Diſcourſe with them, he <hi>found Him whom his ſoul loved,</hi> i. e. came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; or had a ſight and enjoyment of Him. In which Viſion (looking upon Him as actually come) he endeavours to retain Him, and to bring Him into the Temple, there to ſhow Him to all the pious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Divine Majeſty. For that is literally the <hi>Houſe of my Mother:</hi> As <hi>Cheder Corathi (the Chamber of her that conceived me)</hi> I take to be the inward part of that Houſe; or the <hi>moſt Holy place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> And there He expreſſes his affection to him (that is, to the Church, whoſe paſſionate deſires <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here repreſents in the four foregoing Verſes) in the ſame Words, as He had done before in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, ver. <hi>7.</hi> where this Verſe is already explained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6. Who is this,</hi> &amp;c.] Here begins a new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he had of multitudes of people gathering unto Chriſt, like a Cloud of Smoak: which fills his <hi>Companions</hi> with great admiration. For it is their voice, which we read in this Verſe: where the Word <hi>zoth</hi> may be tranſlated either <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>who:</hi> and by the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> may be underſtood the forlorn condition, wherein men were before, not only in <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſm,</hi> but even in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Eſtate. Which made it more wonderful, that the Church ſhould come thus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46873:162"/>richly adorned (expreſſed here by the <hi>Perfumes</hi> of her Garments) to be brought in State and Pomp to the King's Palace; there to be eſpouſed to Him. But all that gave up themſelves to Him becoming thereby an holy people, were highly eſteemed by Him: and therefore compared here to the <hi>Pillars of Smoak</hi> (as I take it) that went up every day from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Burnt-offering, at the Temple, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and aſcended in a ſtrait Line, like a firm Pillar, that was not in the leaſt moved from its uprightneſs, though the Wind blew never ſo boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. So the Jews report in <hi>Pirke Avoth, C. 5.</hi> and in other Books: where theſe are reckoned among the <hi>ten Miracles</hi> which were ſeen in the Temple: that <hi>the greateſt rain never put out the fire; and the moſt vehement winds never diſperſed, or in the leaſt bent the ſmoak:</hi> but it went up ſtedfaſtly to heaven. And how acceptable ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were to Chriſt, is further repreſented by the <hi>ſweet Perfumes</hi> which were burnt upon the Altar of Incenſe. For <hi>Solomon,</hi> I conceive, here alludes (in the laſt Clauſe of this Verſe) to that compoſition, which God ordered to be made of ſweet Spices for his own ſervice at the Tabernacle: which none might preſume to imitate, or make uſe of in other places, <hi>XXX. Exod. 34, 35,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>[g] V. 7. Behold his bed,</hi> &amp;c.] And here is further repreſented in the ſame Viſion, the happy condition of the Church (ſignified by the <hi>Bed of Solomon</hi>) in Society and fellowſhip with Chriſt: of whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was a Type, both in his Royal Perſon, and State and Marriage (as appears from <hi>Pſal. XLV.</hi>) whoſe <hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Throne</hi> (for the <hi>Thrones</hi> of the Eaſtern Kings, were in the form of a <hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Couch,</hi> wherein more perſons than one might ſit, <hi>III.

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:46873:162"/>a determinate Number being named (as the manner is) for an undeterminate.

To whom if we add the <hi>eleven</hi> Princes mentioned in <hi>1 Kings IV.</hi> beginning: and the <hi>twelve</hi> great Officers, which had the care of making proviſion for his houſhold in the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, v. <hi>7.</hi> they make juſt this Number of LX. And may be lookt upon as a Figure of that ſtrong Guard, which is about the proſperity and happineſs of the Church: which is defended by Angels, who are mighty ones indeed, and very numerous <hi>(LXVIII.

                     </p>
                     <p>Some think they find in this Chariot, an imitation of that Seat, whereon God Himſelf ſat between the Cherubims; with which they have compared it: But I cannot be perſwaded that <hi>Solomon</hi> would be ſo audacious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> Nor do I ſee any foundation for the fancy of the Hebrews in <hi>Seder Olam Rabba,</hi> Cap. XV. (which the Chaldee Paraphraſe touches upon) Where they make the day of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Eſpouſals,</hi> to be the next day after the Feaſt which he held <hi>ſeven</hi> days, for the Conſecration of the Temple, <hi>1 Kings VIII. 66.</hi> Which was <hi>the day of the gladneſs of his heart</hi> indeed; but cannot be called his <hi>Eſpouſals.</hi> Which was not the day of his <hi>Coronation</hi> neither; for then he did not ride in a Chariot, but upon his Fathers Mule; and was not crowned by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but anointed by <hi>Zadock</hi> the Prieſt and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, <hi>1 Kings I. 33, 34.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>the day of his eſpouſals]</hi> therefore was the day when he took <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter to Wife; at which time, it was the manner to <hi>crown</hi> married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and his Father being dead, it was done by his Mother. Of this Cuſtom mention is made by many Authors; which the learned Reader may find in <hi>Bochart</hi> his <hi>Geographia Sacra,</hi> Part, <hi>2.</hi> L. <hi>1. C. 25.</hi> Where he applies that Paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> unto this, <hi>XVI. 8, 12. When I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, behold, thy time was the time of love</hi> (i. e. thou waſt fit for marriage) <hi>I entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine; and I put a Jewel in thy forehead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and a beautiful Crown upon thy head.</hi> For the <hi>Miſneh</hi> informs us, that this Nuptial Grown was in uſe among the Jews, as well as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

All which I do not ſee how it is any other way applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Chriſt, than I have expreſſed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.

Exod. 23.</hi> And in the next Chapter, v. <hi>13.</hi> he made <hi>Curtains of Goats</hi> (where we ſupply the Word <hi>hair</hi>) for the Tent over the Tabernacle, according as he had been ordered, <hi>XXV. 4. XXVI. 7.</hi> Upon which Paſſages <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes no mention of <hi>Wool,</hi> either of Lamb or Sheep; becauſe that was vile and contemptible in thoſe Countries, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the hair of Goats: which was wont to be ſhorn not only there, but in other places; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves the ſame of the Goats of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> And ſome of them had a Wool, as we may call it, ſo fine, that it was almoſt as ſoft as Silk: which was that the Women ſpun for the uſe of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>XXXV. Exod. 26.</hi> To this ſort of hair, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, there may be an alluſion in this place, in regard of its <hi>ſoftneſs,</hi> as well as length and thickneſs;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46873:167"/>which is a great commendation of hair in men and women.</p>
                     <p>But there was alſo a <hi>courſer</hi> or <hi>harder</hi> ſort, with which they made Locks and Ornaments for the Head; when they were bald, or would appear very fine: as <hi>Braunius</hi> hath obſerved, in his Book about the Prieſts Garments, L. I. C. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in general it may be obſerved of hair, that it was always accounted a very great Ornament: which made <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> in a Letter of his to a Youth whom he loved, beſeech him by no means to cut it off, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, there being no leſs beauty in a good Head of hair, than in Gold, in Silver, in Pendants, and ſuch like Ornaments. Which he illuſtrates by what it contributes to the greatneſs of ſeveral other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and <hi>Horſe,</hi> &amp;c. and was notably expreſſed by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> when he gave this reaſon, why he ordered in his Laws that his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſhould take care of the growth of their hair, becauſe it made <hi>beautiful perſons more comely, and deformed more terrible;</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in his <hi>Apophthegms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>that appear from mount Giled] Galaad</hi> was a Mountain fit for Goats to brouze on, as may be ſeen in <hi>Bochart:</hi> who ſhows theſe laſt Words of this Verſe, ſhould be thus tranſlated: <hi>that aſcend from Mount Gilead,</hi> to the higher parts, that is, of that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or of that Country.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould have adventured to compare the Apoſtles and Prophets to theſe two <hi>eyes;</hi> who being illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Holy Ghoſt (repreſented by a Dove) and having no other aim, but ſincerely to make Chriſt and his religion known in the World, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>eyes of Doves</hi> (ſee Chap. II. v. <hi>14.</hi>) but I did not know to what the <hi>Locks</hi> and the <hi>Hair</hi> could be handſomely applied; and therefore I have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46873:168"/>lookt upon theſe, and the reſt that follow, only as parts of thoſe things that make up together a perfect beauty. <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath made the apteſt applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I can find, which is this: that <hi>hair</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying what is ſuperfluous, the meaning may be (if there be any of every particular in this Deſcription) that <hi>even in humane things, and worldly Affairs, wherewith we cannot but be ſometime perplexed, the Church behaves her ſelf lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and preſerves a</hi> decorum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2. Thy teeth are like a flock of ſheep]</hi> Here follows a deſcription of the <hi>Teeth;</hi> which are a great part of the beauty of the mouth, as that is of the face. And their beauty conſiſts in their white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in their evenneſs and juſt proportions; and in their cloſeneſs and firmneſs: ſo that there be none wanting, nor any Gap between them. Which are all here expreſſed, and ſaid to be like a <hi>Flock of Sheep come from the waſhing,</hi> in reſpect of whiteneſs; and as equal as if they had been exactly poliſhed and fitted for their places, in juſt proportion, by an Artificer (ſo the Word we tranſlate <hi>ſhorn</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) they that are below alſo anſwering to thoſe above, as if they were <hi>Twins.</hi> And none of them <hi>miſcarry</hi> (ſo that which we tranſlate <hi>barren</hi> ſhould be rendred) <hi>i. e.</hi> drops out of the mouth: which is as much as to ſay, there is a perfect number, as well as order of them.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Teeth</hi> being the Inſtruments whereby we chew our Meat, they may be lookt upon as an apt Emblem of the inferior Paſtors in the Church: who prepare Chriſtian Doctrine for the people. Which Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I have not adventured to make in my Paraphraſe (becauſe I take theſe <hi>five</hi> firſt Verſes to mean no more, but only to ſet forth the lovelineſs of the Church in general, by the Figure of a Virgin, of a moſt accompliſhed beauty) yet, I ſhall here note,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46873:168"/>for the help of thoſe whoſe thoughts lead them that way, that the Vertues of ſuch Paſtors are, <hi>candor, purity, order, concord, exact agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, one of them not ſeeking am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly to over-top the reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3. Thy lips,</hi> &amp;c.] In the beginning of this Verſe there is no great difficulty: it being certain that <hi>Schani</hi> (the colour of the lips) ſignifies ſome very bright and reſplendent colour; which ſtrikes the eyes ſharply (as it originally ſeems to import) <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>Scarlet,</hi> as we tranſlate it, or <hi>Crimſon,</hi> or <hi>Purple:</hi> ſuch as the Poets call <hi>Coral Lips.</hi> Whoſe fineneſs is here compared to a <hi>Thread;</hi> and is another great part of Beauty: as a ſweet accent of the <hi>Voice</hi> alſo is; nothing being more ungrateful than a tone that is coarſe and clowniſh.</p>
                     <p>If any liſt to apply theſe particularly to ſomething in the Church; the <hi>Lips</hi> may be thought to ſignifie the Teachers in the Church, who delivered the Doctrine they had learnt from the higher Miniſters; who had prepared it for them; and, by them, for the people. And then the <hi>voice</hi> ſignifies their excellent manner of preaching: inſinuating into the hearts of thoſe that heard them; being accompanied with great modeſty and humility, though full of authority and power. Unto which only the laſt Clauſe of this Verſe can be applied; which is this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>thy Temples are like a piece of a Pomegranate, within thy locks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Words puzzle Interpreters. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that which we tranſlate <hi>Temples;</hi> which are not reckoned as a part of the beauty of the face, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being cover'd by the <hi>Locks:</hi> and why they ſhould be likened to a <hi>Slice of a Pomegranate,</hi> is hard to tell. <hi>Grotius</hi> therefore, by the Temples under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the <hi>Cheeks</hi> (as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> doth) which in regard of their redneſs, are like to the Grains or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46873:169"/>within a Pomegranate. So the <hi>Chaldee</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed interprets the other Word, a <hi>piece of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate:</hi> when he thus gloſſes, <hi>They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> juſt and pious men to whom he applies it) <hi>with Precepts, as a Pomegranate:</hi> i. e. as a Pomegranate is with Kernels or Grains with which it abounds, and to which that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no doubt, hath reſpect.</p>
                     <p>But our learned Dr. <hi>Caſtell</hi> hath out of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Languages more clearly explained both theſe Words, and the laſt alſo; and hath made them all eaſie and natural, by ſhewing that the whole Clauſe is thus moſt exactly tranſlated: as the <hi>Flower of the Pomegranate, ſo are thy Cheeks without a Veil.</hi> So he tranſlates the laſt Words, which we met withal before, v. <hi>1. mibbaath letſammatech</hi> not <hi>within thy locks;</hi> but <hi>without a Veil.</hi> That is, when thy veil is laid aſide, thy Cheeks appear of a moſt lovely colour; for ſuch is that of the Pomegranate-Flower; the pureſt white and red, moſt exactly mixed.

                        <hi>[d] V. 4.

                     <p>
                        <hi>built for an armoury]</hi> This Tower is ſaid to be built <hi>letalpijoth</hi> (for an <hi>Armory</hi> we render it) which the LXX knew not what to make of, and therefore retain the Hebrew Word: and others do but gueſs at its meaning; having no certain Root, from whence to fetch its Original. <hi>Aquila</hi> tranſlates it <hi>Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;</hi> but <hi>Symmachus</hi> tranſlates it <hi>heighths:</hi> which laſt I have followed, adding another ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo derived from <hi>alaph,</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> or <hi>inſtruct.</hi>

                        <hi>thouſand bucklers]</hi> This Tower it ſeems was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with the <hi>Shields</hi> and <hi>Bucklers</hi> of thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men mentioned <hi>1 Sam. XXIII;</hi> and ſuch like Worthies: With which <hi>Grotius</hi> ingeniouſly compares thoſe precious Stones, which are wont to be the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Neck. But what anſwers to this in the Body of the Church, I know not; unleſs we admit the Opinion of R. <hi>Solomon</hi> and others of that Nation: who will have this to be the place where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had a Room called in their Language <hi>Liskath haggazith, the Chamber</hi> or <hi>Parlour of ſquare Stones</hi> (which ſome Interpreters have thought to be the meaning of <hi>built letalpijoth</hi> with ſquare Stones) where Judgment was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and their Diſcipline preſerved. Which was the ſtrength and ſupport of the Nation, as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of the Apoſtles and Elders, mentioned <hi>Act. XV.</hi> was of the Chriſtian Church: who ſetled all doubts and Controverſies, as future Councils were to do, and thereby maintained the Church in order and peace. From which <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth not much differ, when he ſaith the Church hath many Shields, whereby it is defended. <hi>For thou art armed with all the Weapons of the Spirit</hi> (ſaith he para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſing upon theſe Words) <hi>whereby thou eaſily woundeſt thy Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſometimes doſt refel them by the Prophets, ſometimes by the Apoſtles; and layeſt open their weakneſs.</hi>

                        <hi>[e] V. 5. Thy two breaſts,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>two Paps</hi> riſe upon the Breaſt, like Lilies from the Ground: among which if we conceive two red Kids feeding, that were Twins and perfectly alike, they appeared like the <hi>Nipples</hi> or <hi>Teats</hi> upon the Paps, to thoſe that beheld them afar off. Thus <hi>Bochart</hi> explains this Compariſon: which ſets forth the exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the pure complexion of the <hi>Breaſts;</hi> unto which, moſt think the Two Teſtaments, the Old
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46873:170"/>and the New, very aptly anſwer in the Chriſtian Church, juſt as R. <hi>Solomon</hi> hereby underſtands the two Tables of Stone in the Jewiſh. But they forget that this is a deſcription of the parts of the Church (not of things belonging to it) and can be applied to nothing, that I can think of, but the two Orders of Preachers, that were, one among the Jewiſh Chriſtians, and the other among the Gentiles, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great expounds it. Who thinks theſe are called <hi>Twins,</hi> becauſe of their perfect agreement and concord in the Chriſtian Doctrine: though one of them bent their endeavours moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the converſion of the Jews, and the other of the Gentiles. And indeed they that taught the firſt Rudiments of Chriſtian Doctrine, went forth by Pairs, as we read <hi>Luke X.</hi> where Chriſt is ſaid to ſend them forth <hi>by two and two;</hi> to admoniſh them how neceſſary their concord was; and that they had need to be aſſiſtant, all they could, one to the other in ſuch a difficult Work.</p>

                        <hi>[f] V. 6. mountain of myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c.] Here now the deſcription ſtops, and proceeds no further to the lower Members of the Church: which are not particularly commended, but it is only intimated that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Guides and Directors, they made up a beautiful Body; though for the preſent obſcured by the Night of perſecution, as the firſt Words of this Verſe may be applied. Which Body might be well compared to a <hi>Mountain of Myrrhe, and Hill of Frankincenſe,</hi> that is, to Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſay the Hebrews (and ſo the Church is called the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in the Revelation) where the ſweet incenſe made of theſe and other Spices <hi>(XXX. Exod. 34.)</hi> were continually burnt in the Temple.</p>
                     <p>I know it is commonly thought that other Mountains (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards mentioned, v. <hi>8.</hi>) are here meant: about
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46873:170"/>which I ſhall not diſpute. But only obſerve that theſe two, <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Frankincenſe,</hi> were among the moſt precious Spices of thoſe Countries (and therefore here mentioned) as appears by what we read in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> (L. I. Diepnoſoph. <hi>C. 3.</hi>) who, ſpeaking of the noble Entertainments, which were made by ſeveral perſons that overcame in the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, tells us that <hi>Empedocles,</hi> being a <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> and eating no Fleſh, when he won the Prize, cauſed an Oxe to be made of <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> and other precious Spices, which he divided among the Spectators. And (Cap. <hi>8.</hi>) he puts theſe two among thoſe things, which were accounted <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> that Frankincenſe came out of <hi>Syria,</hi> Cap. <hi>21.</hi> The Verſes alſo of <hi>Archeſtratus</hi> (L. III. p. <hi>101.</hi>) make mention of <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſay theſe were uſed for Perfumes at Feaſts. The ſame I obſerve in other places of that Author; and therefore have made the alluſion here only to the preciouſneſs of theſe things; which were no where ſo excellent as in thoſe Countries. And I have taken this Verſe to be ſtill in praiſe of the before-deſcribed Beauty: for it is evident, from the following Verſe, he had not yet done with that matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7. Thou art all fair,</hi> &amp;c.] And here, to comprehend all that could be ſaid, he enlarges the commendation which he began withal, v. <hi>1.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in theſe Words that there was no defect in any part: but altogether they made up a compleat Beauty without the leaſt ſpeck of deformity. Which is not to be applied to every particular perſon in the Church: but, as I have taken it in the Paraphraſe, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Conſtitution of the whole, in which there was no imperfection.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>[g] V. 8. Come with me from Lebanon,</hi> &amp;c.] Here now begins a new repreſentation; as appears by this that the Style wherein the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſpeaks is altered; ſhe who hitherto hath been called his <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> being now called his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and never before: though very frequently in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Song. Which hath moved Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſuppoſe to uſe this name throughout, rather than the other: as the higher and moſt excellent Title.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theodoret</hi> therefore here begins his <hi>Third</hi> Book, very judiciouſly: and we may look upon this as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Church, coming out of the ſtate of perſecution: and receiving greater teſtimonies of her Saviour<hi>'s</hi> love than ever. For coming from the top of high <hi>Mountains,</hi> where there were <hi>Lyons Dens,</hi> and where <hi>Leopards</hi> inhabited; cannot well ſignifie any thing elſe, than coming from places where they were in danger to be devoured by their Perſecutors: who are compared to <hi>Lyons</hi> in many places of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>As for the Mountains themſelves, they are well-known where they were. Only <hi>Amana</hi> ſome have fanſied to be, that Mountain in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> called <hi>Amanus:</hi> which is reckoned among the higheſt; and joined by <hi>Aelian</hi> with <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Carmel.</hi> We read alſo that there were Tygers and Panthers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Mountain; which hath been brought to countenance this Opinion. But <hi>Judaea</hi> and the Neighbouring places, being the Scene of this Poem, we are not to go ſo far off as <hi>Cilicia</hi> to ſeek for <hi>Amana:</hi> for as <hi>Senir</hi> and <hi>Hermon</hi> were but parts of the ſame Mountains; ſo <hi>Amana</hi> was a part of <hi>Libanus,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath obſerved in his <hi>Canaan,</hi> L. I. C. <hi>5.</hi> And though the lower parts of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Libanus</hi> were very pleaſant; yet the top of it, which is here ſpoken of, was horrid, and inhabited
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46873:171"/>with wild Beaſts. From whence the <hi>Spouſe</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come into more delightful and ſecure places: for ſhe is compared preſently after to a <hi>Garden</hi> or <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> v. <hi>12, 13,</hi> &amp;c. And it is no wonder <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould have the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church in trouble, thus repreſented to him: it being very ſuitable to the ſtate of the Church of the Jews, when it was firſt formed; being then preſſed by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and many other Enemies afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                        <hi>[i] V. 9. Thou haſt raviſhed my heart,</hi> &amp;c.] The firſt Word of this Verſe <hi>libbavtini</hi> (which is not to be found any where elſe) ſignifies ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motion in the heart. And is tranſlated by ſome, <hi>Thou haſt wounded my heart;</hi> by the LXX (which we follow) <hi>thou haſt taken away my heart:</hi> but may as well be tranſlated, <hi>Thou haſt taken poſſeſſion of my heart;</hi> and deeply engaged my affection. Which is expreſſed by the addition of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for her, whom he called <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the foregoing Verſe; and here alſo calls <hi>Siſter.</hi> Which is only a Word of tenderneſs and indearment, uſed by Husbands to their Wives; as appears by the Book of <hi>Tobit;</hi> where <hi>Raguel</hi> calls his Wife <hi>Edna,</hi> his Siſter, <hi>VII. 16;</hi> and <hi>Tobias</hi> call; <hi>Sara</hi> by the ſame name, after he had married her, <hi>VIII. 4, 7.</hi>

                        <hi>one of thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] All the difficulty here is, what may be thought to be meant by <hi>one of her eyes, and one chain of her neck.</hi> Some take <hi>eyes</hi> to ſignifie Faith and Charity; others the Church of the Jews and Gentiles; and then <hi>one eye</hi> muſt ſignifie one glance, one look of thy eyes: but nothing pleaſes me better than the old Interpretation of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuinus,</hi> who by the Word <hi>one</hi> underſtands <hi>oneneſs</hi> or <hi>unity:</hi> and by the eyes (as v. <hi>1.</hi>) the Paſtors and Guides of the Church: And by the one <hi>wreath of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46873:172"/>hair about the neck;</hi> the pious unity of the people ſubject unto them.</p>
                     <p>It may be interpreted alſo, <hi>the leaſt glance I have of thee and of thy beauty, mightily engages my love to thee:</hi> for the eyes are the very <hi>Seat of Love,</hi> as abundance of Authors expreſs it.</p>

                        <hi>[l] V. 11.

Unto which, I conceive, he hath reſpect in this, and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes.</p>
                     <p>I know that very good Authors think he here deſcribes a perfect Virgin; <hi>like a Garden newly encloſed, in which no Seed hath been ſown:</hi> as the Doctors ſpeak in <hi>Perke Eliezer,</hi> Cap. <hi>21.</hi> which hath made ſome Chriſtian Writers apply this to the care of the Church, to preſerve her ſelf pure and undefiled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is more agreeable to what goes before, and follows after, to expound it as <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth of the Church bringing forth not only the fruits of godlineſs and Vertue, but all ſorts and variety of Fruit: like an excellent Garden: and therefore guarded by the ſingular care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her Lord and Owner, from Tyrants and Hereticks; who like wild Beaſts, or Thieves would deſtroy or deflower her.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46873:173"/>but they flow purely. And, indeed, in the Prophetical Language the flouriſhing condition of the Church, after it hath been in affliction, is ſet forth by the planting of a Wilderneſs, with all ſorts of the beſt Trees; and by making Fountains break forth, and Waters flow therein, <hi>XLI.

(juſt like v. <hi>9.</hi> and v. <hi>11.</hi>) reading, it ſeems, in the Hebrew <hi>Gan</hi> a Garden, where we now read <hi>Gal</hi> a Spring. But this doth not at all alter the ſenſe, and therefore need not trouble the Reader.</p>
                     <p>It is poſſible that in the laſt Words of the Verſe, <hi>a Fountain ſealed,</hi> there may be a deſcription of the Chriſtian <hi>Font,</hi> or Baptiſm: to which none were admitted, but ſuch as ſincerely renounced all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; reſolving and promiſing to lead a holy life.

But moſt Interpreters take it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways: And ſome imagine that theſe two, being the moſt vehement Winds in thoſe Countries, are called upon to <hi>blow;</hi> that by their ſtrong ſhaking of the Aromatick Plants, they might make them ſend forth their odours the more plentifully. But it ſeems more reaſonable to think, that theſe two Winds were moſt profitable in their turns, for theſe two purpoſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>North-wind</hi> was uſeful to cloſe the Pores of the Trees, and ſhut up their Effluviums; that they might not ſpend themſelves too much, and be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perpetual evaporations. And then the <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> coming in due ſeaſon, opened and relaxed them again: making the Aromatick Gums drop freely; and the ſweet odours fly more actively abroad.</p>
                     <p>And if this Garden to which <hi>Solomon</hi> here alludes, had the ſame ſituation, which the Maps and Charts give to that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which they place on the Eaſt-ſide of the City, having the Wall on the Weſt) theſe two Winds here mentioned, were thoſe, which alone were deſirable.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46873:178"/>of thoſe Countries, to be partakers. His receiving Fruit from his Garden is expreſſed in theſe Words, <hi>I have gathered my Myrrh,</hi> with the reſt of the Spices mentioned in the former Chapter. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Feaſt, (which they always made when they gathered the Fruits of the Earth) in theſe Words, <hi>I have eaten my Honey comb with my Honey,</hi> &amp;c. Which is put inſtead of all other things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was one of the greateſt entertainments of thoſe Countries.

If by <hi>Myrrh and Spices,</hi> any ſpecial thing be deſigned, I ſhould think it is the <hi>Martyrs;</hi> who offered up themſelves moſt acceptable Sacrifices unto Chriſt, and made greater joy in Heaven, than the meer repentance of a Sinner could do. And the joy that Chriſt took in ſuch victorious Souls, as laid
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46873:179"/>down their lives for Him, nay, did but heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his Doctrine; is expreſſed by their feaſting with Him, <hi>III.</hi> Revel. <hi>20.</hi>

                     <p>The laſt Words, <hi>Eat, O Friends, drink,</hi> &amp;c. may ſoberly be applied to the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> where we feaſt with Chriſt on his Sacrifice, and He feaſts with us, beholding our love to Him and one to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> Here now begins a new <hi>Scene</hi> or Part of this Paſtoral Song. Wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> repreſents himſelf as having loſt that clear ſight of the Meſſiah, which he had in the foregoing Viſion, Chap. III. <hi>4</hi> (for they could not always keep up their minds to ſuch a pitch of contemplation.) But falling into a trance, thought he heard his voice (though he ſaw not his perſon) ſpeaking to his Spouſe. Whom <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> conceives to be in the ſame condition, wherein he then was himſelf; and to hear thoſe Words ſpoken, v. <hi>1.</hi> between ſleeping and waking. So the firſt Words of this Verſe ſignifies, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh:</hi> the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Baalam, XXIV. Numb. 4. falling</hi> (aſleep) <hi>but having my eyes open.</hi> In which condition the Greeks deſcribe their <hi>Saturn;</hi> of whom they ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>ſleeping he ſaw, and waking he ſlept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She having therefore but an imperfect ſenſe of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her, and preſence with her, He awakens her to attend more lively to his love; which He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous more fully to diſcover; and therefore calls upon her by more names of endearment than ever. For here are <hi>four</hi> put together, the following riſing ſtill higher than the foregoing. And he repreſents (after the manner of Lovers) what He had ſuffered to gain her affection: which ſeems to me to be the meaning of the laſt Words, <hi>My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi> Wherein He is repreſented as a beautiful <hi>Nazarite,</hi> having buſhy Hair, and many Locks (as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46873:179"/>
                        <hi>Samſon</hi> had) who having travelled all night to viſit her, was thereby very wet. For there were two ſorts of Dew: the <hi>Morning Dew</hi> which was ſoon gone, <hi>VI. Hoſ. 4. XIII. 3.</hi> and that <hi>Dew which fell in the Night,</hi> and lay long, and wet thoſe, who were in it, very much: Whereby is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in Scripture, hardſhips and great afflictions, <hi>IV. Dan. 25.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are thoſe indeed who by <hi>Dew</hi> underſtand the Evangelical Doctrine, by which innumerable Souls were begotten unto Chriſt, as <hi>David</hi> propheſied, CX. <hi>Pſal. 3.</hi> But this is not agreeable to what follows; and their reaſon for this Expoſition is not true, that <hi>Dew</hi> is always taken in a good ſenſe: for I have ſhown the contrary; and <hi>the dropping</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (a Metaphor taken from <hi>Dew</hi>) is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying <hi>againſt</hi> a place, and threatning Judgments to come upon it, <hi>XXI. Ezek. 2. VI. Amos 16.</hi> which makes me think that <hi>Solomon</hi> here rather alludes to the laſt Verſe of the CXth Pſalm (if he had that Pſalm in his eye) which predicts the troubles and afflictions of the Meſſiah, <hi>by drinking of the Brook in the way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this Expoſition of this difficult Verſe be not allowed, it may be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as coming in the perſon and condition of a poor man, to beg entertainment, and having not where to lay his head (as our Lord ſpeaks) was thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the cold Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which will make this a commendation of Charity to the Church; ſhowing alſo the danger of neglecting it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> And then this Verſe agrees perfectly with what we read in the Parable, <hi>XI. Luke 7.</hi> Where the good man of the houſe was unwilling to be troubled, even by his Friend, that came to beg his aſſiſtance, when he was going to compoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reſt. But I take it to be a deſcription of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46873:180"/>the dullneſs, which is ſometimes apt to creep upon the moſt excellent minds: who, in ſome tempers, are ſo liſtleſs as not to be much affected with the beſt motions that are made to them. Of which infirmity <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> having had many Examples in the Hiſtory of his own Nation, might well conceive the Spouſe her ſelf to be backward to entertain the Grace which was offered to her.</p>
                     <p>There are no difficulties in the Words; which ſignifie plainly, that ſhe having compoſed her ſelf to reſt, and being half aſleep, was unwilling to be diſturbed. For going into Bed, ſhe had put off her cloaths, and waſhed her feet; as the manner was, that no filth which they had contracted in the day time (they wearing Sandals only, not Shoes, as we do) might foul the Sheets: and it would have been a trouble to do all this over again; which is the meaning of the laſt Words. <hi>How ſhall I defile them?</hi> i. e. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily perſwade my ſelf to it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only therefore ſet down the pious note of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> upon theſe Words. <q>Let us learn from hence, what miſchief ſloth and lazineſs doth, and in what troubles and pains it engegeth us. For the Spouſe here excuſing her ſelf, and not being willing preſently to riſe to the Bridegroom, is compelled a little while after, not only to riſe and run to the door, but to run through the City, and wander about the Streets, and fall among the Watch-men, and by them to be wounded; and after all could ſcarce find her Beloved: to whom if ſhe had preſently hearkned, and obeyed his heavenly call, ſhe had avoided all theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are thoſe, not only among us but alſo, in the Romiſh Church, who apply all this lazineſs to the State of the Church after the time of the Great <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> For which I ſee no warrant; but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46873:180"/>think we may rather apply it to thoſe Churches, who, preſently after our Saviour's departure to Heaven, left their firſt Love, and grew cold, as we read in the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Chapters of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For it ſeems probable, by the VIth Chapter of this Book in the beginning of it, that here he ſpeaks of particular Societies, not of the whole Body of the Church.</p>

                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> Yet, ſuch is the infinite Goodneſs of the Divine Nature, he immediately repreſents the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, as not provoked by this neglect, wholly to caſt off his Spouſe: but rather ſtretching forth his hand to awaken her out of this ſecurity. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>He put in his hand by the hole;</hi> i. e. at the <hi>Window,</hi> or <hi>Caſement;</hi> as if he would draw her out of her Bed: or, as it may be interpreted, in a threatning manner, to puniſh her for her ſloth. For ſo <hi>putting forth the hand</hi> ſignifies, to do ſome execution, <hi>1 Sam. XXVI. 9, 11, 23.</hi> Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with what follows, that preſently ſhe was mightily moved thereby, and more than awakened, being full of ſolicitude, and fear, and grief and trouble. Which ſhows indeed, that ſhe did not intend to deny, but only to delay Him: and yet He took this ſo ill, as to put her in great fear of ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from it (as our Saviour doth in his Letters to the Churches, <hi>II. Revel. 5, 16, 22, 23, &amp;c.</hi>) For the Word <hi>Bowels</hi> ſignifies the affections, and paſſions; and the Hebrew Word <hi>hamu,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>was moved,</hi> ſignifies <hi>made a noiſe,</hi> or <hi>was tumultuous:</hi> and therefore denotes the paſſion of trouble and grief, and of fear alſo; nay, of great fear and perplexity. For ſo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> here renders it, <hi>My Belly trembled;</hi> as he doth in <hi>VII. Ezek. 16.</hi> where it is applied to Doves (to whom the Spouſe was here compared, ver. <hi>2.</hi>) and we tranſlate it <hi>mourning;</hi> but it ſhould be rather
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46873:181"/>
                        <hi>trembling like Doves.</hi> For that is their nature, <hi>XI. Hoſ. 11;</hi> all Authors obſerving them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding timorous: and therefore ſo it may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated here, <hi>I was ſo full of trouble, that I qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered like a Dove.</hi>

                     <p>Others by <hi>putting forth the hand</hi> underſtand the touches He gives by his Holy Spirit: which doth not contradict what I have ſaid; threatnings being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Him for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> And having had this glance of Him (whoſe voice only ſhe heard before, v. <hi>2.</hi>) ſhe ſtarts up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and endeavours to correct her errour. And is here repreſented as making ſuch haſte to open the door, that ſhe broke the Veſſel of myrrh, which ſhe ſnatcht up, when ſhe roſe; intending therewith to anoint, and refreſh his head, which was wet with Dew. Or rather her hands ſhaked in that panick fear wherein ſhe was: and ſo ſhe ſpilt ſome of the Myrrh, and it ran about her Fingers. By which is denoted the great ſpeed ſhe made to ſhake off her ſloth, now ſhe ſaw her danger; and the fear that came upon her, leſt ſhe ſhould loſe her Beloved: to whom ſhe now reſolved to expreſs the greateſt affection imaginable. For it was not barely <hi>Myrrh</hi> (which was one of the moſt excellent Spices, <hi>XIX. Joh. 39.</hi>) but the moſt <hi>precious Myrrh</hi> which ſhe took up to carry to Him. So <hi>mur ober</hi> ſignifies; which we well tranſlate <hi>ſweet-ſmelling Myrrh:</hi> but, word for word, is <hi>current Myrrh.</hi> Either in that ſenſe wherein Money is called current, <hi>XXIII. Gen. 16.</hi> as ſome fanſie; or, as <hi>Raſi</hi> thinks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit, that is the odor of it diffuſed it ſelf round about the place where it was; that is, was exceeding fragrant: or, as <hi>Bochart</hi> will have it, was that which <hi>wept</hi> (as they ſpeak) and dropt from the Tree of it ſelf; which as it was the moſt unctuous, ſo was the richeſt and beſt for all manner
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46873:181"/>of uſes. See his <hi>Phaleg,</hi> L. II. C. <hi>22.</hi> And beſides this, <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> obſerves that out of Myrrh, being beaten, there flowed an Oil, called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> But notwithſtanding her repentance, ſhe was thus far puniſhed for her ſloth, that her Beloved abſented himſelf from her, for a time: and ſhe could not hear the leaſt tydings from Him, or notice of Him. Which caſt her into ſuch an exceſs of grief and fear, that ſhe ſwooned away, and was like a dead Body (ſo that Phraſe <hi>my Soul went forth</hi> ſignifies to die, <hi>XXXV. Gen. 18. XLII. 28.</hi> and other places.) And recovering her ſelf again was extremely troubled, by the reflections ſhe made upon his kindneſs, and her inſenſibleneſs of it. For which ſhe askt his pardon, and ſought his favour; but could receive no tokens of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> I take Watchmen here in a good ſenſe, as before <hi>(III. 3.)</hi> unto which I refer the Reader. And only obſerve, that <hi>to find</hi> a perſon, ſignifies ſometimes in Scripture-Phraſe, as much as to fall upon him, as we ſpeak; and that on a ſudden, <hi>I. Judg. 5. XXI.</hi> Pſal. <hi>8. CXIX. 143. X. Iſai. 10.</hi> And ſo I have expounded it here; and referred the ſmitting and wounding her, to the reproaches they caſt upon her. For there is a ſmiting with the tongue, as well as with the hand; and that not only by Enemies unjuſtly, <hi>XVIII. Jer. 18.</hi> but by Friends out of love and charity, <hi>CXLI. Pſal. 5.</hi> For there is not a greater kindneſs, than ſometimes even to upbraid us with our faults. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſed by <hi>taking away her Veil</hi> from her; as much as to ſay, expoſing her to ſhame: a Veil
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46873:182"/>being thrown over Womens faces for modeſty-ſake, as well as in token of ſubjection, <hi>XX. Gen. 16.</hi> And ſo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Laeta,</hi> takes this <hi>Veil</hi> or <hi>Pallium,</hi> as he calls it, to be <hi>pudicitiae ſignum,</hi> a ſign of chaſtity: and therefore to take it away, was to repreſent her as an impudent, whoriſh Woman. <hi>Greg.

                        </gap> (Hom. XII. upon this Book) the Nuptial Veil; which, together with the face, covered the whole Body: and therefore to be diſrobed of it was the greater reproach; becauſe it was to diſown her to be his Spouſe, as ſhe profeſſed her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> This Verſe is very plain, expreſſing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable temper of a true Penitent: who leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted to recover the favour of her Lord (for finding no comfort from the Watchmen, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the help of all good people) and yet doth not complain of what ſhe ſuffered, nor of the harſhneſs of thoſe, who ſhould have helpt to reſtore her; and not dealt ſo ſeverely with her (according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>VI. Gal. 1.</hi>) but only bewails the loſs of his preſence, and repreſents that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe had not loſt her Love to Him; but rather that it was ſo great, ſhe could not live without Him.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be confeſſed that there is no neceſſity of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Words which we tranſlate <hi>that ye tell him,</hi> by an Interrogation, <hi>What will you tell him?</hi> as the Hebrew ſeems to import (for the Particle <hi>mah</hi> doth not always denote that) but it adds much to the life of the ſpeech, and repreſents her paſſion to the heighth, if we ſo tranſlate it; as I have taken it in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.</hi> In this Verſe the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to her; and being touched with a pitiful concern for her (whoſe admirable beauty diſcovered it ſelf to them, in this wretched condition wherein they ſaw
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46873:182"/>her) they deſire to have a Character of her Beloved: that they might be the better able to know Him, if they met Him; and be the more excited to help her to ſeek for Him, when they underſtood his deſerts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> In this part of the Character, which now follows of Him, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to me, to have had his eye upon the Perſon of his Father <hi>David, 1 Sam. XVI. 12.</hi> whoſe very aſpect promiſed much, and ſhowed that he was born to rule. And whether we tranſlate the firſt Words, <hi>white and ruddy</hi> as in our Bible; or as <hi>Bochartus, white and ſhining,</hi> or <hi>gliſtering</hi> (making <hi>adom</hi> not to ſignifie <hi>ruber,</hi> but <hi>rutilus,</hi> and the whole to be as much as <hi>ſummè candidus,</hi> exceeding fair and of a pure complexion) it matters not. For it only ſignifies, in my opinion, the Majeſtick Beauty of his aſpect: which <hi>David</hi> himſelf had alſo deſcribed in thoſe famous Words, <hi>XLV. Pſal. 2. Thou art fairer than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then, in the latter part of this Verſe, he hath reſpect, as I take it, both to what they ſang of his Father <hi>David,</hi> after he came from his Victory over <hi>Goliath, 1 Sam. XVIII. 7.</hi> and to what <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſang of this great Prince, in that XLVth Pſal. <hi>3, 4, &amp;c.</hi> and more largely, CXth Pſal. <hi>2, 3, 5, 6.</hi> Which all relate to the conqueſt of the World unto Him: and is ſignified in this expreſſion of his being <hi>chief</hi> (or <hi>lifting up the Standard</hi>) <hi>over ten thouſands;</hi> that is, over great multitudes or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>III. Pſal. 6.</hi> The LXX tranſlate it, <hi>Choſen out of ten thouſand:</hi> unto which I have had reſpect alſo in the Paraphraſe. As for myſtical ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications; ſome think by <hi>white and ruddy</hi> is meant his Divine and humane Nature: others, only his humanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as may be found in Interpreters) but I have not dared to meddle with them. And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46873:183"/>ſhall but juſt mention the fancy of the <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> who underſtand hereby the effects He works in us. For ſometimes He diſpenſeth Himſelf in Mercy and Kindneſs; and then, ſay they, He is <hi>white:</hi> ſometimes in the zeal of Juſtice, and with Anger; and then He is <hi>red.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> Now being thus repreſented as a King, He is next deſcribed as having a Crown upon his head. So I underſtand <hi>Cethem</hi> (which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Gold</hi>) as <hi>Raſi</hi> doth: who takes it for a <hi>Diadem:</hi> and, indeed, in other places of Scripture it ſignifies ſome precious Ornament, as <hi>XXV. Prov. 12.</hi> Now this Crown upon the head is ſaid to be ſuch an one, as <hi>David</hi> had mentioned before, <hi>XXI. Pſal. 3.</hi> of <hi>pure Gold.</hi> In the Hebrew of <hi>Paz;</hi> which <hi>Bochartus</hi> (both in his <hi>Phaleg,</hi> L. II. C. <hi>27.</hi> and in his <hi>Canaan,</hi> L. I. C. <hi>46.</hi>) ſhows was the Iſland anciently called <hi>Taprobana:</hi> in which the footſteps of this Word <hi>Paz</hi> remained in <hi>Prolemy's</hi> time. Who mention in that Iſland the River <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> and the Creek, or Bay, <hi>Paſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame excellent Perſon, in his Book of Sacred Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals (Par. <hi>2.</hi> L. <hi>2.</hi> C. <hi>10.</hi>) ſhows that, in the latter part of this Verſe, we are to underſtand by <hi>kevjzoth (Locks)</hi> the Foretop, or the Hair coming down the Forehead; which is expreſſed in the next Word, <hi>taltalim,</hi> hanging down. And this Foretop is only mentioned, becauſe little elſe appeared, when the head had the Crown on it.</p>
                     <p>This Hair is ſaid to be as <hi>black as a Raven;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch ſhining black Hair was accounted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick, and much affected in thoſe Countries: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they endeavoured by Art, to make their Hair of this colour; and, as <hi>Pliny</hi> informs us, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Eggs, the Blood and the Brain of Ravens for that purpoſe. They lookt upon this coloured Hair alſo as a token of courage and fortitude; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46873:183"/>with a pure clear complexion, it was very lovely.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral myſtical applications made of this: which I had rather the Reader, who hath a mind to them, ſhould ſeek in others, than find here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> The plaineſt meaning of this Verſe, is that of the LXX and Vulgar Latine: which is to the ſame effect with that I have ſet down in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe. For <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>ſitting</hi> do not referr unto the <hi>eyes,</hi> but unto <hi>Doves:</hi> who love to <hi>ſit,</hi> nay to <hi>tarry</hi> (as the Word imports) by River-ſides, and other places which abound with Water; and are then ſo pleaſed, that their eyes appear very quick and lively. And ſuch piercing eyes, adding much to Majeſty, they are here made a part of this glorious Perſons Character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>waſhed with milk]</hi> ſignifies <hi>Doves as white as milk:</hi> which are moſt lovely; and when they have waſhed themſelves, look as if they had been in Milk.</p>
                     <p>As for the common ſenſe which the Hebrews give of this Verſe, and which moſt modern Interpreters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>Bochartus,</hi> in the beginning of his Second Part of <hi>Sacred Animals,</hi> ſeems to me to have evinced, that the Hebrew Words will not bear it. But it is fit to mention it, and it amounts to this; that his eyes were <hi>clear and white and full ſet</hi> (or ſet in perfection, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> here interprets the Word <hi>milleth</hi>) like a Diamond or Precious Stone in a Ring: neither too much depreſſed, nor too prominent; but handſomely filling the Sockets. And if this were the natural Interpretation of the laſt Phraſe, <hi>Joſcheboth al milleth,</hi> ſitting or dwelling by fulneſs or fillings; I ſhould think there might be an alluſion to the Precious Stones in the Pectoral of the High Prieſt, which are ſaid to be <hi>ſet in their fillings, XXVIII. Exod. 17, 20.</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:46873:184"/>But this Phraſe doth not referr, as I ſaid to <hi>eyes,</hi> but to <hi>Doves;</hi> that ſit by places abounding with water; or, as <hi>Avenarius</hi> will have it, <hi>ad vas plenum Lacte,</hi> by a Veſſel full of Milk.</p>
                     <p>The myſtical application of theſe eyes to the Doctors of the Church, ſeems impertinent; becauſe they are deſcribed before in the eyes of the Spouſe, <hi>IV. 1.</hi> Rather therefore his exact care and providence over the Church, which nothing can eſcape, may be hereby repreſented: for He ſees into the very heart and reins, as He himſelf affirms, <hi>II. Revel. 18.23.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> This Verſe is ſo difficult, that it is a hard matter to give an account of it. The plaineſt ſeems to be this; that by <hi>cheeks</hi> we are no to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe that are ſmooth; but wherein the hair begins to grow: which added much, in thoſe days, to the goodlineſs of any man, and was lookt upon as a token of vigour, ſtrength and courage. And it may aptly be compared to the <hi>Flowers,</hi> or the <hi>ſproutings</hi> and <hi>buddings</hi> of Plants and Trees. So I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Migdaloth</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>Flowers</hi>) to ſignifie <hi>Buds,</hi> putting forth like little <hi>Towers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lips</hi> may ſeem unfitly compared to <hi>Lilies:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe white Lips are not beautiful. But <hi>Almonazir</hi> hath obſerved out of <hi>Dioſcorides, Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Pliny;</hi> that there were Lilies of a Purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And beſides, I find in <hi>Pliny</hi> (L. XXI. C. <hi>5.</hi> mention made of a Lily, (which he calls <hi>rubens Lilium,</hi> which was much eſteemed, he ſaith, in <hi>Syria</hi>) He ſhows there alſo a way how to make Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Lilies.</p>
                     <p>There are thoſe who think <hi>Solomon</hi> compares the Lips to Lilies, only in regard of their fineneſs, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſoftneſs: thick, blubber-Lips, being very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom, and a ſign, alſo they ſay, of dullneſs, and making the ſpeech leſs grateful. And indeed, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46873:184"/>is ſometimes deſcribed by Lilies; and may be here meant.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>ſweet-ſmelling Myrrh,</hi> ſee v. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus far we have only the deſcription of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gracious Majeſty: which is much advanced by a ſweet voice and eloquent ſpeech. The mention of which, may well put us in mind of what is ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>IV. Luke 22.</hi> compared with <hi>XLV. Pſal. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14.]</hi> If we underſtand the firſt Part of this Verſe to be meant of the hands, it is thus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, <hi>He hath Golden Rings on his Fingers</hi> (as before he is ſaid, v. <hi>11.</hi> to have a golden Head, i. e. <hi>a Crown of Gold</hi> upon it) <hi>ſet with the Chryſolith:</hi> as <hi>Tarſis</hi> (which the LXX here do not tranſlate) it is moſt probable ſignifies. And then the latter part of the Verſe ſounds thus, word for word; <hi>his Belly is of poliſhed Ivory, covered with Sapphire:</hi> i. e. is purely white ſtreaked with blue Veins. But, who ſees not that though this be ingenious, yet it is not true? For the Body is no where <hi>covered</hi> (as the Word here is) with Veins: which muſt needs ſignifie more than <hi>ſtreaked</hi> here and there. And beſides, it is not only againſt the Rules of decency, but againſt the very ſcope of this Diſcourſe, to fanſie that any of thoſe naked Parts of the Body are here deſcribed, which are not commonly expoſed to every Bodies view. For the Spouſe is deſired to tell, by what marks this perſon might be diſcovered, v. <hi>9.</hi> now He could not be known by any of thoſe parts which lie concealed and hidden from all mens eyes, being induſtriouſly covered. And therefore no ſuch hidden parts are here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; becauſe He could not thereby be known and diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that now ſhe proceeds to deſcribe the habit of this Great Perſon. And <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:46873:185"/>having in his mind the <hi>Idea</hi> which his Father had given him of the Meſſiah, in the CXth Pſalm, (where He is ſaid to be a Prieſt as well as a Prince) repreſents Him in the habit of the High Prieſt. Who, among other noble Veſtments, had an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Coat;</hi> the <hi>Sleeves</hi> of which, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews tell us, came down to his very Wriſts; nay, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith, as far as to the hollow of his hand. Which I take to be here meant by <hi>his hands</hi> (which comprehend the <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>) that is, the clothing of thoſe Parts. And theſe <hi>Sleeves,</hi> as well as the whole Coat, were <hi>embroidered</hi> (as you read, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 4.</hi>) to make the High Prieſt appear the more glorious. And if you ask what this <hi>Embroidery</hi> was, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews tell us, that part of it conſiſted in a kind of <hi>oilet holes,</hi> finely wrought. And R. <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> expreſly ſaith upon that Text, that <hi>they were holes made in golden Rings, in which were fixed Precious Stones,</hi> &amp;c. (as is afterward ſaid of the Stones of the Ephod, v. <hi>11.</hi>) Which ſo fully explains theſe Words, <hi>His hands are as Gold Rings, ſet with the Beryl,</hi> that I need ſeek no further. Though I have ſometimes thought, that the <hi>Ephod</hi> it ſelf might be here intended: which being faſtned upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi> (which in order, after the head, eyes, cheeks and lips, come to be here deſcribed, and are comprehended, as I ſaid before, under the name of <hi>his hands</hi>) hung down before and behind to the bottom of the back: and had <hi>two golden Rings,</hi> unto which the Breaſt-plate was faſtned, as we read <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 27, 28. Maimonides</hi> ſaith it had <hi>four</hi> Rings: two above, at the Jewel-Buttons; and two below, about the Girdle of the <hi>Ephod.</hi> Which was one of the principal Ornaments of the High Prieſt, when He miniſtred: the other, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46873:185"/>greateſt of all, was the <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; and, as they ſay, was to be inſeparable from the Ephod.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> is meant, as I take it, in the latter part of this Verſe. Where under that Word which we tranſlate <hi>Belly,</hi> and properly ſignifies <hi>Bowels,</hi> is comprehended the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and all: Which this CHOSCHEN, as the Hebrews call it, covered: and as it covered thoſe parts, ſo was it ſelf covered, or <hi>overlaid</hi> with <hi>twelve</hi> Precious Stones. The <hi>Sapphire,</hi> which was the <hi>tenth,</hi> is only here mentioned; but it is uſual in Scripture, to touch only upon one thing in a Hiſtory, when the whole is intended. And beſides, it is evident from the foregoing part of this Verſe, that more muſt be underſtood, when one alone is mentioned: for <hi>Rings</hi> are ſpoken of in the Plural Number, and ſaid to be filled with <hi>Tarſis;</hi> which muſt therefore denote more Stones than one; as <hi>Sapphire</hi> doth all the reſt of the <hi>twelve,</hi> which could not be mentioned in ſo ſhort a deſcription. Or <hi>Sepphirim</hi> here, in the Plural Number, may ſignifie Stones as precious as the <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire.</hi> Certain it is the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> thought there was ſome reſpect here to the High Prieſt's <hi>Breaſt-plate;</hi> for he mentions all the Stones therein, one by one. Which may make this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mine to ſeem leſs ſtrange. And I conceive the <hi>Sapphire</hi> to be here mentioned rather than any other; becauſe it is of the colour of the Heavens, and fitteſt to repreſent the ſublime Dignity in which He is now deſcribed. For the Pavement under the feet of the God of Iſrael, when He appeared unto their Nobles at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was of this colour, <hi>XXIV. Exod. 10.</hi> and ſo was the Throne of God in the Firmament, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw, <hi>I. Ezek. 26.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:46873:186"/>
Nor need it ſeem ſtrange that the <hi>Belly,</hi> upon which this covering was, is ſaid to be of <hi>poliſhed Ivory</hi> (when there is no mention of any ſuch thing in the Law) for it only denotes that it was as ſhining and bright as that: and may poſſibly relate to the Tunick or Coat of fine Linen, wherein the High Prieſt was to miniſter <hi>XXXVIII. Exod. 39. XXXIX. 27.</hi>) eſpecially upon the great day of expiation, when he was not to put on his Robe, nor his fine Linen Coat, with any Embroidery, but of fine Linen alone, <hi>XVI. Lev. 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The LXX ſeem to think it was the Breaſt-plate it ſelf (which indeed was very ſhining) for they tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: which ſhows they meant ſome covering of the Belly which was hollow; as the Breaſt-plate was. Which I doubt not is the <hi>covering of Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires</hi> here mentioned: it being ſet, as you read, with <hi>twelve</hi> large Precious Stones, wherein were engraven the names of the twelve Children of Iſrael. And was the moſt precious part of all the High Prieſt's habit; and therefore more commonly called by the Jews an <hi>Ornament,</hi> than a <hi>Garment,</hi> or any part of his Veſture: the whole of which was contrived <hi>for Glory and for Beauty,</hi> XXVIII. Exod. <hi>40.</hi> i. e. that God might be ſerved moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[p] V. 15.]</hi> Next in order follows the deſcription of the <hi>Thighs;</hi> that is, of the Garments upon the Thighs: which were the very firſt that the High Prieſt put on, when he went about to clothe himſelf for his Miniſtry. And are here ſaid to be made of <hi>Scheſch:</hi> which is a Word common to <hi>fine Linen,</hi> and to <hi>pure white Marble</hi> (ſo the LXX twice tranſlate it <hi>Parian Marble, I. Eſth. 6. 2 Chron XXIX. 2.</hi>) which the <hi>Breeches</hi> of the Prieſt reſembled, being made of <hi>Byſſus,</hi> or pure fine Linen; a thing of great price in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46873:186"/>as appears both by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> The latter of which Authors in his <hi>Eliaca,</hi> mentions this among the rare things (which were worthy of admiration) in that Country; and ſaith, <hi>It was not inferiour to the Byſſus of the Hebrews.</hi> Who were ordered to make this part of the Prieſt's Garments of <hi>twined fine Linen, XXXIX. Exod. 28.</hi> which rendred them the more ſubſtantial; and made them ſit the fuller and ſtiffer, like <hi>Pillars.</hi> For the Hebrews ſay they were made of <hi>ſix-thread Byſſus:</hi> and that they came down to the Knees; where they were not gathered at the bottom, but ſat open.</p>
                     <p>Below which <hi>Breeches</hi> came down the holy <hi>Meil</hi> or Robe, upon the Skirts whereof hung round about Bells made of pure Gold, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 34.</hi> Which may poſſibly be the Baſis of fine Gold, here mentioned, to which the <hi>Femoralia,</hi> or Garments on the Thighs, reached. Some refer all this only to his ſtately gate, and Princely motion: others to his ſtrength and firmneſs (which lies much in the Thighs) and his ability to march againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and purſue them. And then the Sockets of fine Gold are his <hi>Sandals,</hi> bound upon his feet with golden Ribbands, or ſomething of that nature. The Reader may chuſe which he thinks moſt probable, for the explication of the firſt Part of this Verſe, <hi>His legs</hi> (or <hi>thighs</hi> rather) <hi>are as pillars of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſet upon ſockets of fine Gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if my conjecture be allowed, then the latter part of the Verſe will not be hard to explain. For this and all the reſt of his habit being contrived for <hi>Beauty and Glory,</hi> as was ſaid before from <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 40.</hi> it made the High Prieſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with an unuſual Majeſty: the riches of theſe Veſtments being not eaſily to be valued. And ſo his <hi>countenance,</hi> or rather his <hi>aſpect,</hi> his <hi>whole
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46873:187"/>appearance</hi> (as the Hebrew Word may ſignifie) <hi>was as ſtately as Lebanon.</hi> Which was one of the goodlieſt Sites in thoſe Countries both for Cedars; and many other things: eſpecially after <hi>Solomon</hi> had made his Garden there, of which we read in the foregoing Chapter, ver. <hi>15, 16.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto which lovely Foreſt and Garden, the appearance of the High Prieſt may be the better compared; becauſe there were Flowers, as well as Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, if we may believe <hi>Philo</hi> (in his <hi>third</hi> Book of the <hi>Life of Moſes</hi>) wrought in the bottom of the holy Robe. Which the LXX alſo affirm in expreſs Words; that there was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a <hi>flowry Work,</hi> as well as <hi>Pomegranates</hi> and <hi>Bells</hi> in the Hem of the <hi>Meil, XXVIII. Exod. 34.</hi> And indeed the Pomegranates being made of Wool of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, they themſelves might look like divers ſorts of Flowers. And, beſides this, it is to be obſerved that ſeveral other parts of the High Prieſt's habit are peculiarly commanded to be made of a Work called <hi>Choſcheb,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning work.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ephod</hi> is ordered to be wrought, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 6.</hi> and the <hi>Girdle</hi> of it, ver. <hi>8.</hi> and the <hi>Breaſt plate,</hi> v. <hi>15.</hi> Which ſome tranſlate <hi>artificial,</hi> others <hi>ingenious work:</hi> and all agree to have conſiſted in certain beautiful Figures of Flowers, and Animals; and in variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. The <hi>Girdle</hi> moreover is ordered to be made of a Work called <hi>rokem,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,</hi> ver. <hi>39.</hi> becauſe it is thought not to have differed from the former, ſave only in this; that the other things were only woven curiouſly, but this alſo curiouſly wrought with the Needle. The Jews give another difference; that this was wrought ſo that the Figures appeared on both ſides, the other only on one. About which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf, but only take notice that <hi>Joſephus</hi> (in his <hi>third Book of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:46873:187"/>Chap. <hi>8.</hi>) explains this Work thus, <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were woven in this Girdle, with Scarlet, Purple, Blue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>Flowers,</hi> and (as others ſay) <hi>Animals,</hi> then in all probability, <hi>Trees</hi> alſo were wrought in theſe Prieſtly Veſtures: which made the fuller repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Foreſt. Among which that of <hi>Lebanon</hi> was the principal, and indeed the moſt beautiful place in all thoſe Countries, which made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expreſs the Glory of the Church in theſe Words, <hi>The Glory of Lebanon ſhall be given to it, XXXV.

                     <p>Some think that hereby only the tallneſs of his Stature is denoted; which was always lookt upon as a Princely thing, as it was in <hi>Saul.</hi>

                     <p>As for myſtical applications of theſe two Verſes, there are none to be ſought for, if I have given the true ſenſe of them, but ſuch as relate to the excellency of Chriſt's everlaſting Prieſthood; and its preheminence above the other, as much as the Cedar excells all the Trees of the Forest.</p>

                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.]</hi> The Daughters of Jeruſalem (mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>V. 8.</hi>) here juſtifie what the Spouſe had ſaid in the Concluſion of the former Chapter: And declaring themſelves in love with Him whom ſhe had deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are deſirous to join themſelves to her Company, and go in queſt of Him. In order to which, they would know, Whither ſhe thought He was gone, when He went from her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> Unto which ſhe replies in this Verſe, and ſeems to tell them, in his own Words, what ſhe had heard Him ſay about that matter, <hi>V. 1.</hi> And it ſignifies, that He was ſtill in his Church, and in every part of it; though ſometimes they were not ſenſible of it. For ſo <hi>Theodoret</hi> well obſerves, here is diſtinct mention made of a <hi>Garden</hi> and of <hi>Gardens.</hi> i. e. of the Catholick Church, which is but one, and of the ſeveral parts thereof. For
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46873:190"/>ſometimes St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions only the <hi>Church</hi> in the Singular, Number, and ſometimes the ſeveral Churches, even in the ſame Nation (as in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Galatians, I. 1.</hi>) and in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or City, <hi>1 Cor. XIV. 34.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is ſaid here to <hi>go down</hi> into his Garden, with reſpect to the Mountains mentioned <hi>IV. 8.</hi> And to <hi>feed,</hi> in the Hebrew, is either to do the Office of a Shepherd to his Flock; or relates to his Communion with his people, mentioned Chap. <hi>IV. 16. V. 1.</hi> Which may be the meaning alſo of <hi>gathering Lilies:</hi> or, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> will have it, by this laſt Clauſe, is to be underſtood, his gathering holy and pure Souls, that are like Him, and joyning them unto his Church. And ſo the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tranſlation is, <hi>to gather together the Lilies;</hi> following the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> who tranſlate it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And indeed I find the Hebrew Word <hi>lakat</hi> ſignifies to collect things into an Heap or Bundle; as Stones, <hi>XXXI. Gen. 46. Manna, XVI. Exod. 27. Fruit, XIX. Lev. 9. Silver, XLVII. Gen. 14.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole denotes, that Communion with Him is only to be ſought in his Church: eſpecially in that part of it, which preſerves the Order, wherein He hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all things (like the Walks and Beds in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) and keep themſelves alſo in the purity of his Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> Now ſhe ſeems to have ſo perfectly recovered her ſelf out of the ſlumber wherein ſhe had been, as to have regained her former ſenſe of Him, and of her intereſt in Him: repeating thoſe Words which we met withal before, Ch. <hi>II. 16.</hi> Of the latter part of which <hi>[he feedeth among the Lilies]</hi> I think fit here further to note, that <hi>to feed</hi> may relate either unto Himſelf, or unto others: for there are Examples of both. Of the former, <hi>XLI. Gen. 2. I. Job 14.</hi> Of the latter, <hi>XXIX. Gen. 7, 9.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46873:191"/>XXXVII. 12.</hi> I take it here rather in this latter ſenſe, and ſuppoſe it ſignifies his doing the Office of a Shepherd: and that he is ſaid <hi>to feed among the Lilies,</hi> as in the Revelation, <hi>to walk in the midſt of the ſeven Candleſticks,</hi> i. e. there to have his converſation, to take up his abode with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as He often ſaith in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John (XIV. 23.)</hi> that He would with thoſe, who love Him and keep his Commandments.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch perſons are here compared to <hi>Lilies;</hi> which being a name given by Chriſt to Himſelf, <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> hereby, not unfitly, underſtand, ſuch as are conformed to Chriſt their Head, and have his Image wrought in their Souls, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. For, ſaith the former of them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. whatſoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt,</hi> &amp;c. (ſee <hi>IV. Philip. 8.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>theſe are the Lilies in which Chriſt delights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> And now we muſt conceive, either that they went to the Garden together, and there found Him; or that He hearing this hearty profeſſion of unmoveable love to Him, meets them: and, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her drooping Spirits, falls again into a new commendation of the Spouſe; in the very ſame terms as before, and in ſome higher.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> He compares her to <hi>Tirzah,</hi> which was a beautiful Situation, in the Country of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and therefore made choice of after theſe times, by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for the Seat of his Kingdom: and ſo continued till the Building of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as we read <hi>1 King. XIV. 17. XV. 21, 23.</hi> and ſeveral other places: to which add <hi>XII. Joſh. 24.</hi> The very original of the Word ſignifies; as much as <hi>Urbs amabilis,</hi> or a City that pleaſeth one: and therefore choſen by one of the ancient Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> for the place of his reſidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:46873:191"/>
And leſt this ſhould not be high enough, He next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares her to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which was the moſt lovely place in the Territories of <hi>Judah,</hi> and indeed of the whole Country. For which cauſe, as it had been the Seat of one of the Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo the Royal Palace of <hi>David,</hi> nay the Houſe of God himſelf, was afterward there built: and is called by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his Lamentations, <hi>the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth, II. 15.</hi> It is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> likewiſe, L. <hi>5.</hi> C. <hi>14.</hi> as the moſt famous City in the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>And as ſhe had commended Him before not only for his Beauty, but Majeſty: ſo He doth here, in the laſt place, call her <hi>terrible as an Army ſtanding in Battalia's;</hi> ſtriking an awe, that is, into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. So I think it is to be expounded, as referring ſtill to the goodlineſs of her aſpect, and not to her being invincible, inexpugnable, and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrour into her Enemies; as ſome interpret the whole Verſe. Every part of which ſeems to me to be a new proof, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks not in this Book of one ſingle perſon (whom ſome fanſie the <hi>Shulamite,</hi> others <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter; whom others take for one and the ſame) under the name of the Spouſe: but of a Body or Society of men; for none elſe can be fitly compared to Cities, nay to great Armies drawn up under their Banners. Which laſt part of this Verſe may be applied to the comely Order, which Chriſt appointed in his Church; which, while it was preſerved, made the Church very venerable in the World. So <hi>Theodoret</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. For they are aſtoniſhed who behold thy Order, there being nothing diſorderly, nothing uncertain or undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nothing confuſed and indiſtinct: but all</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>orderly appointed, and judiciouſly determined.</hi>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46873:192"/>
Some refer this <hi>terribleneſs,</hi> as we tranſlate it; to the <hi>gravity,</hi> or rather <hi>ſeverity</hi> of her countenance: which forebad all wanton approaches to ſo great a Beauty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> In this and the following Verſes, He ſeems to deſcend to a particular deſcription of the ſeveral parts of her Beauty: as He had done before, Chap. <hi>IV. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> And He doth it in the very ſame Words, for the moſt part, to aſſure her that He had ſtill the ſame Eſteem of her and kindneſs for her: and that, notwithſtanding what had happened, it had not altered her ſo much, as to abate any thing of his affection; or to make her appear otherwiſe in his eyes than ſhe had done. This ſeems to me to be the true reaſon of this repetition: others are given by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and other Authors.</p>
                     <p>And firſt He begins with the commendation of her <hi>eyes,</hi> as He had done <hi>IV. 1.</hi> (though in other Words.) For ſo the firſt Clauſe of this Verſe may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>turn thine eyes towards me:</hi> the Hebrew Phraſe, ſignifying not only to turn ones ſelf from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but ſometimes to turn towards them; as <hi>1 Chron. XII. 23.</hi> And then we are to conceive that He ſpeaks to her, as one aſhamed to look upon Him; whom ſhe had ſo much diſobliged: and bids her take more confidence, for He was ſtill in love with her.</p>
                     <p>If we follow the common Tranſlation, I take the ſenſe ſtill to be the ſame: that ſhe need not trouble her ſelf any further; for ſhe had prevailed in her ſute to be reſtored to his favour. The looking of the eyes towards one, is as much as entreating and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning: which He tells her ſhe might ceaſe, by bidding her turn her eyes away from Him.</p>
                     <p>But it is moſt ordinarily taken for an amorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: as if He had ſaid, her eyes were ſo bright and dazling, he could not bear the paſſion they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:46873:192"/>
Of the latter part of the Verſe, ſee an account upon Chap. IV. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> There is no difference between this Verſe and that in <hi>IV. 2.</hi> but only in one Word; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the ſenſe. And as <hi>harechelim, ſheep</hi> was to be fetcht from hence to ſupply the ſenſe there: ſo another Word, <hi>hakketzuboth, even ſhorn,</hi> is to be fetcht from thence to ſupply it here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> This is alſo exactly the ſame with the latter end of the <hi>third</hi> Verſe of the IVth Chapter. The LXX have alſo the <hi>firſt</hi> part: but they might as well have added all that there follows; which is here omitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Here, moſt think, <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes to the number of his own Wives; who were fewer, they ſuppoſe, in the beginning of his Reign (as <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> himſelf gathers from theſe Words, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the now Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> p. <hi>126.</hi>) and that then he compoſed this Song, before he let the Reins of his luſt ſo prodigiouſly looſe, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we read he did, <hi>1 King. XI. 1,</hi> &amp;c. But it is not at all likely that he had ſo many as are here mentioned, while his mind was filled with ſuch Divine raptures as theſe: And therefore I ſuppoſe he alludes to the cuſtom of other Princes in the Eaſt; who, beſides their principal Wives that were ſolemnly eſpouſed and endowed, had alſo another ſort who were neither: and yet were Wives, called by the Hebrews <hi>Philagſhim, Concubines.</hi> And ſuch a difference the <hi>Romans</hi> antiently made between her whom they called <hi>Matrona,</hi> who was only taken in marriage; and her whom they called <hi>Materfamili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> who was taken alſo to order and govern the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and whoſe Children inherited. As may be ſeen in <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> L. XVIII. C. <hi>8.</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes <hi>Aelius Meliſſus,</hi> a conceited Grammarian, who had ſtarted other, ungrounded Notions of theſe Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:46873:193"/>
And then <hi>threeſcore</hi> and <hi>fourſcore,</hi> are only a certain number for an uncertain; not the preciſe number of theſe Wives and Concubines. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thinks by theſe are myſtically intended, ſeveral Ranks of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Church: ſome more, ſome leſs perfect: But they diſcourſe better, in my Opinion, who rather accommodate theſe to the ſeveral ſorts of Heretical and Schiſmatical Churches: ſome of which gloried in the multitude of their Followers, and in their wealth and ſplendour: but Chriſt hath only one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, more glorious than them all put together; as it follows here in the next Verſes. And thus, in effect, R. <hi>Solomon Jarchi,</hi> and ſome other Hebrew Expoſitors, underſtand theſe Words, with application to themſelves. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, ſay they, till the Deſcendants from <hi>Iſrael</hi> were <hi>threeſcore</hi> in number (compared here to <hi>Queens.</hi>) The Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> and their Deſcendants unto <hi>Abraham</hi> were <hi>fourſcore</hi> (compared to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.) The reſt who came from <hi>Cham, Iſhamael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> could not be comprehended under a certain number. And ſo the meaning is, Whatſoever kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs God had for the reſt of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity or of <hi>Noah</hi>'s (not to mention <hi>Cham, Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) yet I have choſen, ſaith God, my people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom I have eſpouſed to my ſelf, by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and by the Law, and by Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> This Verſe needs not much Explication: wherein the Spouſe is oppoſed to all the forenamed Beauties: who are conſtrained to confeſs her prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence. The Hebrew word for <hi>one,</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>onely:</hi> and an <hi>onely</hi> Child, is as much as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Child: As appears by this, that <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>well-beloved,</hi> are Words of the ſame import in the New Teſtament. And if ſuch an only Daughter be alſo <hi>barah</hi> (<hi>choice</hi> we tranſlate it, or) <hi>pure,</hi> as the Word originally
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46873:193"/>imports; free from all blemiſh (that is, a perfect Beauty) it makes her ſtill more dearly beloved.</p>
                     <p>It is in vain to enquire here, who is the <hi>Mother</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this place: for his love is only compared to the <hi>love</hi> of a Mother toward ſuch an onely Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: who hath ingroſſed, as we ſpeak, all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities that are in any other perſon. Which forced the Daughters to admire her (ſo <hi>ſaw her</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; they lookt upon her with admiration) and the Queens to bleſs her; and the Concubines to proclaim her praiſes. Thus it is moſt likely the latter part of this Verſe ſhould be interpreted, <hi>the Daughters ſaw her, and the Queens bleſſed her, and the Concubines they praiſed her.</hi> For though the Jews now have otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed the Words, by their Accents; yet <hi>Maimonides</hi> I obſerve diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them, as I have done, in his Preface to <hi>Seder Zeraim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> from this and ſuch like places of this Book <hi>(IV. 8, 12. V. 1.)</hi> proves there is but one onely holy Catholick Church; making this Obſervation (Epiſt. <hi>75.</hi> Edit. Oxon.) <hi>we ſee one perſon every where mentioned,</hi> and no more; <hi>becauſe the Spouſe alſo is one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> This ſome take to be the beginning of a new part of this Song; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar here begins his IVth Book of Commentaries upon it: but I look upon theſe Words, as the praiſes and commendations, which the <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> before-mentioned, beſtow upon the Spouſe; with admiration and aſtoniſhment at her tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Beauty.</p>
                     <p>They need no explication, being of known ſignification; onely it is fit to note that, to make the Elegy more magnificent, the ſpeech grows and encreaſes. For though the <hi>morning</hi> be very beautiful and agreeable to every eye; yet the <hi>Moon</hi> is ſtill more bright;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46873:194"/>and the <hi>Sun</hi> far brighter than that: but <hi>all the hoſt of heaven</hi> (which I take to be meant in the laſt Words) ſtill more wonderful and amazing. For there being a gradation in this place, and all the other expreſſions relating to the heavens, it is reaſonable to think that this doth ſo too: and that we are to underſtand by it the <hi>Armies or Hoſt of Heaven</hi> (as the Scripture calls the Stars) rather than Armies upon Earth. However, I have put both into the Paraphraſe; but have not medled with myſtical applications: They that deſire them, may look into the Commentaries of three Fathers, where this Verſe is applied to the four Degrees of Chriſtians that are in the Church. Others, with more reaſon, apply it to the progreſs which the Church her ſelf made in ſplendor and greatneſs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt like the <hi>morning,</hi> when the day breaks, after a long night of ignorance: and then the light of Chriſtian Knowledge advanced, till the Church appeared like the <hi>Moon</hi> (whoſe paleneſs may ſerve for an Emblem of the terrours, which perſecution ſtruck into their hearts) till, in the iſſue, it diſperſed all miſts, and conquering all oppoſition, ſhone like the <hi>Sun:</hi> and then was ſettled in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time like a well-ordered Army, which beat down all Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>They that would ſee more of theſe applications may look into <hi>Commenius</hi>'s Book <hi>de Bono Unitatis;</hi> in the Beginning whereof there are applications of theſe things, both unto the Church in general, and unto particular Churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> This ſeems to be the voice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom declaring what returns He expected to his love. The Word <hi>agoz</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Nuts</hi> (of which there were ſeveral kinds, ſome very rich, as the <hi>Piſtick</hi>) is found only here: and by ſome is tranſlated <hi>ſhorn</hi> or <hi>cut;</hi> which I have not omitted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46873:194"/>in my Paraphraſe. And <hi>beibe hannachal (Fruits of the Valley)</hi> the LXX tranſlate <hi>Shoots by the Brook,</hi> or River, where Plants are apt to grow beſt: which is very agreeable to the Original.

                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> The meaning of this Verſe ſeems to be, that the Spouſe, hearing ſuch high commendations of her ſelf, both from Him, and from the perſons mentioned, v. <hi>10;</hi> with great humility ſaith, that ſhe was not conſcious to her ſelf of ſuch perfections (for ſo the firſt Words ſound in the Hebrew, <hi>I did not know it,</hi> or <hi>I did not think ſo</hi>) but is excited thereby to make the greateſt ſpeed to endeavour to preſerve this Character He had given her; and to go along with Him into his Garden (which ſhe had neglected before, <hi>V. 2.</hi>) there to give a good account of her proficiency. For which end ſhe ſeems on a ſudden, to take leave of her Friends (who had been ſo charitable, as to go along with her to ſeek Him) that ſhe might, for ſome time, enjoy his Company alone: Which is the ground of their calling upon her to return, in the next Verſe. This is the beſt account I can give of theſe two laſt Verſes.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuppoſed <hi>Ammi-nadib</hi> was ſome great Captain who purſued his Victories, or advantages very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly, with very ſwift Chariots.</p>

                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> This Verſe is the voice of her Companions or Friends; ſome of which wiſh for her coming back, that they might enjoy her Company again, and ſee how ſhe was improved: and the reſt ask what they expected to ſee in her? to which the other reply in the laſt Words, <hi>as it were the company,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The repetition of the Word <hi>return,</hi> four times over, expreſſeth their vehement affection to her, and their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46873:195"/>deſires to have her Company again: whom they called <hi>Sulamith;</hi> as much as to ſay <hi>Jeruſalamith.</hi> For the name of that place, formerly was <hi>Salem,</hi> which carries <hi>peace</hi> in its ſignification; or, as others will have it, <hi>perfection:</hi> for <hi>Shalam</hi> in the ſecond Conjugation, ſignifies to finiſh, or perfect. And is a fit name here for the Church, the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> built by Chriſt Himſelf. This ſeems to me a great deal more probable than the conjecture of <hi>Menochius,</hi> (L. III. <hi>de Repub. Hebr.</hi> C. XXI. n. <hi>14.</hi>) who, becauſe Wives, when they were married, took the name of their Husband, thinks the Spouſe from <hi>Solomon</hi> had the name of <hi>Sulamith:</hi> which <hi>Aquila</hi> tranſlates <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>To <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>look upon her,</hi> ſignifies to enjoy her happy Society; and the benefit of her excellent Vertues and perfections. Whom, in the two laſt Words, He ſeems to me to compare unto the Choices of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Hoſts. For the Word <hi>Mechola</hi> doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any kind of <hi>Company;</hi> but of ſuch as dance or ſing: as may be ſeen in <hi>XV. Exod. 20. XXXII. 19. XI. Judg. 34. XXXI.

And <hi>Mahanaim</hi> (which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>two Armies</hi>) may as well be a proper name as <hi>Ammi-nadib</hi> in the Verſe foregoing: and relates to the appearance of Angels to <hi>Jacob, XXXII.

                     <p>Which agrees with what follows, <hi>The work of the hands of a cunning Workman.</hi> Where <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> alſo ſignifies, not any Artificer, but a <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,</hi> who (as <hi>Bochart</hi> hath obſerved) made Wires, Laces, Wreaths, Rings, and ſuch like little Ornaments of Gold and Silver, as Women uſed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe applies all this, to the peoples going up three times a year to the publick Feaſts: as R. <hi>Solomon</hi> before-named, expounds alſo that place in <hi>LII. Iſai. 7. How beautiful upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are the feet,</hi> &amp;c. Which, with more reaſon others apply, to their return into their own Country, out of Captivity; and the Chriſtian Writers apply to the Apoſtles, going through the World to preach the Goſpel. Whoſe ſtedfaſtneſs herein, may be alſo here repreſented: though I ſee not why it may not as well be applied to Chriſtians going cheerfully to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in their publick Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> The Garments, I doubt not, of theſe Parts are ſtill deſcribed in this Verſe. For what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance hath the <hi>Belly</hi> it ſelf of any perſon (which it had not been ſeemly neither to deſcribe) unto <hi>an heap of Wheat ſet with Lilies?</hi> And they ſeem to me to have had in their eyes, that <hi>Apparel of wrought Gold,</hi> mentioned <hi>XLV. Pſal. 13.</hi> and repreſent that part of it which covered the <hi>Belly,</hi> to be of <hi>raiſed</hi> or <hi>emboſſed</hi> Work, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling an <hi>heap of Wheat.</hi> By which it is poſſible may be meant, <hi>many Sheaves of Wheat</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:46873:198"/>embroidered round about (as the Kings Daughters raiment was, <hi>XLV. Pſal. 14.</hi>) with Flowers, eſpecially with <hi>Lilies.</hi> And then this was a Figure wherein <hi>Harveſt</hi> was repreſented: which is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely conjecture; for anciently nothing was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than to follow Tillage or Paſturage. From whence it is, that we find in the latter end of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s 18th <hi>Iliad,</hi> that the device contrived by <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> in <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Shield, were Reapers, cutting down ripe Corn: and the King himſelf ſtanding in a furrow and providing a Dinner for them.</p>
                     <p>Now in the very midſt of this Work, I conceive there was a <hi>Fountain:</hi> which I take to be the meaning of the firſt Words of the Verſe, <hi>Thy Navel is a round Goblet, which wanteth not Liquor:</hi> that is, <hi>a great Bowl or Baſin, was wrought in the Center of the Embroidery; full of Water, which ran continually from above into it.</hi> Or, a <hi>Conduit, running with ſeveral ſorts of Liquors, into a great Bowl.</hi> Unto which the Word <hi>hammazog</hi> importing a <hi>mixture</hi>) ſeems to incline the ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>agan,</hi> which properly ſignifies <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as the LXX tranſlate it, a <hi>great Bowl</hi> or <hi>Baſin;</hi> is uſed by the Chaldee Paraphraſt for a receptacle of Water, in Fountains or in Ditches. As in <hi>IV. Judg. 11.</hi> where the <hi>Valley</hi> or Plain of <hi>Agannaja,</hi> of Bowls, which was in <hi>Kedeſh,</hi> is interpreted by <hi>Kimchi,</hi> the Field in which were many Pits or Trenches, like to Bowls, full of Water.</p>
                     <p>This ſeems to be a plainer Interpretation, than that of <hi>Zanchez;</hi> who fanſies this to have been ſome Jewel, that hung down from her Girdle upon the Navel; which was of this form, round like the Moon. And the Chaldee Paraphraſt underſtood it to be of this Figure, when he applies it <hi>to the Head of their School, who ſhone in the knowledge
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46873:199"/>of the Law, like the Circle of the Moon: and ſeventy Wiſe men round about him, like a Heap of Wheat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the myſtical meaning of this <hi>Hieroglyphick Veſture</hi> (as it may be called) is very hard to ſay. It may be applied to the two Sacraments, which the Church adminiſters to her Children: the Font in Baptiſm being repreſented by the former; and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper by the other part of this Figure.</p>

                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> This Verſe hath been explained before, <hi>IV. 5.</hi> I only obſerve, that the Chaldee Paraphraſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies theſe two Breaſts to the <hi>two Meſſiahs,</hi> whom they fooliſhly expect; the <hi>Son of David,</hi> and the <hi>Son of Ephraim:</hi> who ſhall be like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. Which I mention, becauſe it ſhows that the Jews have an Opinion, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is diſcourſed of in this Book; and that theſe Words are to be applied to the Leaders of the Church, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Of which ſee in the place before-named.</p>

                     <p>Among <hi>Pools,</hi> thoſe fair ones at <hi>Heſhbon</hi> were much celebrated; which were in the very entrance of the City, hard by the Gate called <hi>Bath-rabbim;</hi> becauſe it opened towards the way that led to <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the Metropolis of the Children of <hi>Ammon:</hi> which made the more people paſs in and out at it. For <hi>Heſhbon</hi> we find in <hi>XXI. Numb. 24, 25, &amp;c.</hi> was the principal City of <hi>Sihon,</hi> whoſe Country bordered upon the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> and it fell to the ſhare of the <hi>Gadites,</hi> who deſired this Country becauſe it abounded with Paſturage, and was excellently wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: there being many Rivulets and Brooks in its Neighbourhood, from whence the <hi>Pools of Heſhbon</hi> were ſupplied. Which were remarkable for their <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>ſerenity,</hi> or <hi>quietneſs:</hi> and therefore fitter to repreſent the compoſed, ſetled eyes of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe gravity and Majeſty, I ſuppoſe, is alſo ſet forth in the next Words by comparing her <hi>Noſe</hi> to that <hi>Tower which was in Lebanon;</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at a diſtance among the Trees, eſpecially on that ſide which lookt toward <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) as the Noſe in the Face, doth among the Locks of Hair, that fall upon the Cheeks.</p>
                     <p>A large, but well-proportioned Noſe, was always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a conſiderable part of Beauty: and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, it was generally thought, of greatneſs of mind and heighth of ſpirit. Some add, that it is a token of ſagacity and prudence: and the Noſe being the inſtrument of ſmelling, they apply it to the great judgment and foreſight of the Doctors of the Church; who, they think, may be hereby intended. For as the Chaldee Paraphraſt applies this whole Verſe to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> who governed the Affairs of that people (who were as full of Wiſdom, ſaith
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46873:200"/>he, as a Pool is of Water) ſo Chriſtians generally by <hi>Eyes</hi> underſtand the Guides and Governours of the Church. Who may the better be compared to the <hi>Pools of Heſhbon;</hi> becauſe it was, after the Conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> one of the Cities of the <hi>Levites (XXI. Joſh. 39.)</hi> whoſe Office it was to inſtruct the people. And ſuch being called by the Jews <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,</hi> and in the Singular Number <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buni,</hi> ſome have fanſied that they are alſo denoted in the name <hi>of the Gate of Bath-rabbim.</hi> For <hi>bath (daughter)</hi> ſignifies people, or inhabitants; who were taught by thoſe Great Men (as <hi>Rabbim</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) what was Law and Judgment in the Gates of their Cities. <hi>Damaſcus</hi> alſo being a great Enemy to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and noted for Idolatry, they ſuppoſe, the Noſe being turned towards the <hi>Watch-tower</hi> looking that way; is an Emblem of the care that Chriſtian Doctors ſhould take that their people be not ſeduced to Idolatrous Worſhip. We do not read any where in Scripture of this Tower: but that it was a <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower</hi> the Word <hi>zophe</hi> here intimates: which we tranſlate <hi>looketh;</hi> but ſignifies <hi>looking like a Watchman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> It appears from the very Phraſe, <hi>Thine head upon thee,</hi> that they mean the covering of the head. And this being a deſcription of her utmoſt perfections, it denotes, I conceive, the Crown or Garland which ſhe wore (as ready for her Nuptials) reſembling the top of <hi>Carmel.</hi> Which was another beautiful Mountain in that Country, whoſe Head was covered with great variety of Flowers and Trees. Certain it is, that as it was a rich and fruitful, ſo a very pleaſant and lofty place <hi>XXXV. Iſai. 2. II. Jer. 7.</hi>) and therefore fitly choſen to ſet forth the Dignity and Majeſty of the Spouſe.</p>
                     <p>But there is no neceſſity, it muſt be confeſſed, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this of the Mountain <hi>Carmel:</hi> but the Words
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46873:200"/>may be tranſlated, <hi>Thy head is like a pleaſant fruitful Field.</hi> For ſo the Word <hi>Carmel</hi> (from the goodlineſs, perhaps, of that Mountain) ſignifies in many places, <hi>XVI. Iſai. 10. XXXII. 15. XLVIII. Jer. 33.</hi> where <hi>joy and gladneſs is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>taken micarmel</hi> from <hi>Carmel:</hi> which we truly tranſlate <hi>from the plentiful</hi> (or pleaſant) <hi>Field.</hi> For there the Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>Moab,</hi> in which Country <hi>Carmel</hi> it ſelf was not. And this is an illuſtration of Beauty in other Authors: who compare the head of a delicate Woman unto a fair Meadow or Field. As <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> writes to his Wife, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next Word <hi>dallath</hi> is never uſed any where for Hair; but ſhould rather be tranſlated the <hi>Hair-lace:</hi> that wherewith the Hair, and all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to it, were tied up. This <hi>Hair-lace</hi> is ſaid here to be of a <hi>purple colour,</hi> i. e. it was rich and noble. For this was the Royal Colour, and therefore called here the <hi>Purple of the King</hi> (as the Vulgar Latine takes it, joining the latter part of the Verſe with this) <hi>tied up in folds, hanging down like canals;</hi> that is, hanging looſe upon the ſhoulders (as ſome expound it) it waved up and down: imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the frizzles and curls of the water in Canals. Others referr the two laſt Words to <hi>Purple;</hi> lying in Canals, to receive a deeper tincture, by being double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. Vid. <hi>Menoch. de Repub. Hebr.</hi> L. I. C. X. n. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the LXX make the laſt Words a diſtinct Sentence, as we do, in this manner; <hi>The King is tyed or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46873:201"/>bound in his Walks.</hi> That is, when he walks in his Palace Royal, and beholds her beauty, he ſtands ſtill, and cannot take his eyes off from her; being captivated with it, and tied as faſt to her, as the Hair of her Head is to the Lace that binds it.</p>
                     <p>The former part of this Verſe is applied by the Chaldee Paraphraſt to the <hi>King</hi> (the Head of the people) <hi>who ſhall be juſt like</hi> Elias; <hi>who was zealous for the Lord of Hoſts, and ſlew the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon Mount</hi> Carmel: and the latter part of it to their <hi>poor, who ſhall be clothed by him in Purple; as</hi> Daniel <hi>was in</hi> Babylon, <hi>and</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai <hi>in</hi> Shuſhan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> This Verſe may be taken either for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>love,</hi> which had thus adorned her and raiſed her to this pitch of happineſs: or of <hi>her,</hi> who is called <hi>love,</hi> in the abſtract; to expreſs more vehemently how lovely ſhe was, and what pleaſure they took in beholding her Beauty.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Word <hi>fair</hi> may relate to the rare compoſition of the whole Body: and the next Word <hi>pleaſant,</hi> or <hi>ſweet,</hi> or <hi>comely</hi> (as ſome tranſlate it) to her graceful motion, geſture, and ſweet converſation. And the ſenſe, in ſhort, is this: <hi>O how deſirable, do the pleaſures which thou imparteſt, make thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Note here is very pious; that we become thus beautiful and lovely (though deformed before) by delighting in Charity; and making doing good, our higheſt pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> This Verſe is a reflection upon the whole foregoing deſcription; as appears by the firſt Word <hi>zoth, this:</hi> As if they had ſaid, <hi>to all this thy ſtature is proportionable.</hi> Which is compared to the <hi>Palm-tree;</hi> becauſe it ſhoots up ſtraight as well as high: and therefore ſets forth that part of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46873:201"/>which conſiſts in tallneſs. Which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought a great addition to Beauty; and was one reaſon why Women wore Ornaments upon the very top of their Heads, as well as high Shoes, to make them appear the taller. The nobleſt Palm-trees of all other, were in <hi>Judaea</hi> (eſpecially about <hi>Jericho</hi>) as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, L. XIII. C. <hi>4.</hi> From whence it was that in future times, it became an Emblem of that Country: as we find in that Medal of the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> with a Captive Woman ſitting under a <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> and the Inſcription of <hi>Judaea Capta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our learned Country-man, Sir <hi>Tho. Brown</hi> (in his <hi>Miſcellan. Tracts,</hi> p. <hi>78.</hi>) hath ingeniouſly obſerved that they ſpeak emphatically, when they ſay they will <hi>go up to take hold of the Boughs</hi> of this Tree. For it muſt be aſcended, before one can come at the Boughs which it bears only at the top and upper parts. But the Trunk or Body of it is naturally contrived, <hi>denſis, gradatíſque corticum pollicibus, ut or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibus</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> there ſpeaks) with Rings in the Bark, orderly diſpoſed, like ſteps, whereby it may be very eaſily climbed.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Cluſters,</hi> to which the Breaſts are here compared, ſome think, are nothing but the Fruit of this Tree, viz. <hi>Dates:</hi> for it is not expreſſed in the Hebrew what <hi>Cluſters</hi> theſe were; the Word <hi>Grapes</hi> being added by our Tranſlators of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>Who ſuppoſed, as others do, that Vines ran up the Palm-tree in thoſe Countries: which agrees well with what follows in the next Verſe, where the <hi>Cluſters of the Vine,</hi> are mentioned, as a fit Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of her Breaſts. Which were deſcribed before, v. <hi>4;</hi> but now mentioned again: to ſhow that they lookt not merely at the Beauty, but the uſefulneſs of that which is meant thereby. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes this pious Obſervation upon it, That <hi>though
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46873:202"/>the Church be deſcribed as ſublime, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven</hi> (as his Words are) <hi>yet ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates her ſelf to the weakeſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Souls: ſtretching out the Breaſts of her Doctrine to all that need it. For the Bunches of the Palm-tree,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hang down very low.</hi> Which muſt be underſtood, not of their hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down near the Earth, but below the Boughs: which are all at the top, and very high. For which reaſon <hi>Menochius</hi> (L. VII. <hi>de Repub. Hebr.</hi> C. VIII. n. X.) thinks it not to be true, which <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> here notes; that the Vines in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> were joined unto Palm-trees; becauſe the Palm-tree hath not Boughs fit to ſupport the Branches of the Vine:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> I take this Verſe to be ſtill the voice of the ſame perſons, though in the Singular Number (as appears from the mention of the <hi>Beloved,</hi> v. <hi>9;</hi> which ſhows it is not He that ſpeaks here, but ſome other perſon) For one ſpake in the name of the reſt; (as <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the name of his other three Brethren, <hi>II. Dan. 30, 36.</hi>) or the whole <hi>Choire</hi> is conſidered but as one perſon: who deſire to have fellowſhip and communion with the Church in her Benefits. Of which having taſted, they ſay, <hi>now alſo thy Breaſts ſhall be as Cluſters of the Vine;</hi> that is, now we ſhall enjoy thoſe delicious pleaſures before-mentioned, v. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which we tranſlate <hi>Noſe,</hi> in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe, the Vulgar tranſlates <hi>countenance</hi> (or <hi>mouth</hi> rather) agreeable enough to the Hebrew; and moſt agreeable to the reſt of the Words. For that which is <hi>ſmelt</hi> is the breath, coming out of the mouth: compared to the fragrancy of <hi>Citrons, Oranges, Peaches,</hi> or other ſorts of <hi>tappuach;</hi> which is a name (I obſerved above, <hi>II. 5.</hi>) common to all ſuch Fruits, as well as thoſe we peculiarly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46873:202"/>call <hi>Apples:</hi> and indeed ſignifies any Fruit, that hath a fragrant odour breathing from it.</p>
                     <p>And this may be thus myſtically expounded, <hi>And now ſhall we delight to hang upon the Breaſts of the Church, and the Breath or Spirit of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; ſweeter than Grapes, or the ſmell of any other Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> Which is further explained in this Verſe. Where the <hi>roof of the mouth,</hi> i. e. the Words which come from thence, it compared to the moſt excellent Wine: which was ſo choice, that it was fit only to be preſented to him, to whoſe love they owed all they had (or ſo delicious, as our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath it, that it went down glibly) and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, that it put ſpirits into thoſe who were quite ſpent with Age; nay, raiſed thoſe who were, in a manner, dead. So this Character of the <hi>beſt Wine</hi> runs word for word, in the Hebrew: <hi>It goeth ſtraight to my Beloved, and cauſeth to ſpeak, the lips of old people, or of thoſe that ſleep:</hi> that is, are dead. For this Word <hi>Jeſchenim,</hi> our Tranſlators thought, may either ſignifie, <hi>old men,</hi> or <hi>men aſleep:</hi> though exact Grammarians will not allow it; but make a great difference between <hi>jeſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi> and <hi>Jeſchanim.</hi> The firſt of which (which is the word here) they ſay, never ſignifies old men, but only <hi>Sleepers.</hi>
                     </p>

Or they were but preparing for it, by the culture He had begun to beſtow upon them: which, from the following Verſe, ſeems to be the meaning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cepharim,</hi> Villages, are oppoſed in Scripture to <hi>Cities, 1 Sam. VI. 18.</hi> and ſignifies ſmall Towns, and Hamlets, as we ſpeak, <hi>1 Chron. XXVII. 25. VI.

I paſs by other Applications, which may be found in Interpreters; and only add this Note of my own, That the Goſpel was firſt preached in <hi>Cities</hi> moſtly,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46873:203"/>and from thence ſpread it ſelf in time into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Villages:</hi> in which Idolatry laſted ſo much longer than in Cities, that they gave the name of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> This Verſe ſuppoſes thoſe Fields (v. <hi>11.</hi>) not to have been quite uncultivated; but that there were <hi>Vineyards</hi> (that is, <hi>Churches,</hi> in the Myſtical ſenſe) planted in them. And her deſire is, that He would accompany her, in viſiting them <hi>early;</hi> that is, <hi>very diligently,</hi> as the Word ſignifies in many places. Thus in the <hi>XXXIX. Ecclus. 5.</hi> it is ſaid of a juſt man, that he will give his heart <hi>to reſort early to the Lord that made him.</hi> Which is ſuitable to what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>V. Pſal. 1.</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah XXI. 12. XXV. 2, 3.</hi> Thus <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> here expounds it, <hi>It behoveth us to uſe all ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diligence, in viſiting thoſe that have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received the preaching: whether they bring forth more than Leaves; and eſpecially, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Beginnings of Charity appear among them.</hi> For ſo he expounds, <hi>if the pomegranates bud forth.</hi> And this, ſaith he, is the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of love to Him: which He makes the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the laſt Words, <hi>there will I give thee my loves.</hi> For what care we beſtow upon them, He accounts as done to Himſelf: according to his own Words, <hi>in as much as you have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vines</hi> may ſignifie the leſſer ſort of people; and the <hi>Pomegranates</hi> the greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> The Word <hi>Dudaim</hi> is found only here, and in the <hi>XXX. Gen. 14.</hi> Where we read how <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives contended for them, as a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that is, a rare and delicious Fruit. For none can imagine they ſtrove about that now called by us <hi>Mandrakes;</hi> which are of a ſtinking ſmell, and very offenſive; or about any ordinary Flower,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46873:204"/>ſuch as <hi>Violets</hi> or <hi>Jaſemin</hi> (by which ſome-expound this Word) which they might have ſent out their Maids to gather eaſily every where. <hi>Ludolphus</hi> therefore in his late <hi>Ethiopick Hiſtory</hi> (L. I. C. IX. n. <hi>23.</hi>) hath happily conjectured that it ſignifies the Fruit which the Arabians call <hi>Mauz</hi> or <hi>Muza</hi> (called by ſome the <hi>Indian Fig</hi>) which in the Abyſſine Country is as big as a <hi>Cucumber;</hi> and of the ſame form and ſhape, <hi>Fifty</hi> of which grow upon one and the ſame Stalk; and are of a very ſweet taſte and ſmell: From which cognation (as he calls it) of a great many upon the ſame Stalk, he thinks it took the name of <hi>dudaim.</hi> Which ſome derive from <hi>dod,</hi> either as it ſignifies <hi>love,</hi> or a <hi>breaſt;</hi> with which they fanſie this Fruit to have had reſemblance.</p>
                     <p>So the ſenſe of this Verſe is, that they found more there than they expected: or, that by her care the moſt excellent Fruit was produced from people of the beſt rank (who may be underſtood by this moſt rare ſort of Fruit) and that, every where: ſo that they needed not to be at the trouble to go far to gather it. For at their very <hi>Gates</hi> there where <hi>Megadim,</hi> all precious Spices (mentioned before, <hi>IV. 13. V. 1.</hi>) and thoſe both <hi>new and old</hi> (a Phraſe for plenty and variety) which as a faithful Steward, ſhe ſaith, ſhe had laid up for Him; with the ſame care that we do the moſt precious Treaſure. So the Word <hi>ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanti (I have laid up)</hi> is uſed, <hi>XVII. Pſal. 13. CXIX. 11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At the gates</hi>] may alſo ſignifie as much as juſt ready to be gathered; or to be brought home.</p>
                     <p>Some apply <hi>new and old,</hi> to the knowledge of the Old and New Teſtament, by which Idolatry was vanquiſhed, and true Religion planted in the World: and they think our Lord Himſelf alludes to this place in thoſe Words, <hi>XIII. Matth. 52.</hi> where he ſpeaks
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46873:204"/>of a wiſe Scribe that <hi>bringing forth out of his Treaſures things new and old.</hi> Others apply <hi>new and old,</hi> unto thoſe Vertues, that flow only from Faith, Hope and Charity; and thoſe that are planted in us by Nature. But I think it may moſt aptly be accommodated to the ſpiritual Gifts, which were newly beſtowed upon the Church by the Holy Ghoſt, after our Lord went to Heaven; and the temporal Bleſſings, which they enjoyed before: which were now all reſerved for Him, to be employed in his ſervice. And ſo theſe Words ſeem to me to have a reſpect unto the <hi>CX. Pſal. 3.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>In the day of his power, they ſhould be a people of free-will Offerings.</hi> For when men give up themſelves to God ſincerely, they readily devote all they have to his uſes; when He hath occaſion for it. And thus the firſt Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did; who brought all their Goods into his Treaſury: and other Nations afterward made plentiful Oblations, as need required; thereby fulfilling another Prophecy, <hi>LXXII. Pſal. 10.15.</hi> Unto which <hi>Megadim</hi> may have reſpect: for ſuch precious things as Silver and Gold, as well as the excellent Fruits of Trees, are called by this name; as may be ſeen, <hi>XXXIII. Deut. 13, 14, 15, 16.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>[a] Verſe 1.]</hi> This Verſe, at firſt ſight, looks like a repetition of the ſame deſire wherewith he began this Book; that they might be ſo happy as to ſee the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> appear, though it were but in his infancy; which would tranſport them with joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> interprets it, of the time when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall be revealed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if we conſider what follows, it will be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to connect it with what went before: and to take it for a moſt ardent expreſſion of love to the perſon before-ſpoken of; with a deſire to have more intimate familiarity with him; ſuch as a Siſter hath with a Brother, when he is a ſucking Child; whom, if ſhe met in the Street, ſhe would not be aſhamed to take out of his Nurſes Arms into her own, and openly kiſs; and not imagine ſhe ſhould thereby incur any reproach or contempt.</p>
                     <p>This ſeems to be the moſt literal ſenſe of the Words; which may be applied to the open profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, with the greateſt confidence and ſecurity; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more innocent and harmleſs, than the love and ſervice, wherein it engages its Diſciples to their Lord and Maſter Chriſt. Who the more obedient any perſon is to God's commands, holds that man or woman the dearer to Him; even as dear, as a <hi>Brother, Siſter, or Mother, XII. Matth. 50.</hi> Which (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> upon that place) is the myſtical ſenſe of the Song of Songs. See more in my Preface.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[b] V. 2.]</hi> This dear Lord (i. e. the knowledge of Him) ſhe deſires here to carry ſtill further: till ſhe had brought Him into the <hi>houſe,</hi> that is, into the Family of her Mother. Which may be applied unto
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46873:208"/>the deſign of God, to awaken the Jews to believe on Chriſt, by bringing in the <hi>fulneſs,</hi> that is a vaſt number, <hi>of the Gentiles, XI. Rom. 25.</hi> Which the Apoſtle ſaith there, v. <hi>15.</hi> would be <hi>life from the dead:</hi> Unto which the laſt Words of this Verſe may be accommodated.</p>
                     <p>For after ſhe had ſaid ſhe <hi>would lead him,</hi> or <hi>bring him down;</hi> and then <hi>bring him into the houſe</hi> of her Mother; ſhe adds, <hi>thou ſhalt teach,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt me.</hi> Which agrees with what the Apoſtle there writes, v. <hi>12.</hi> that if the fall of the Jews was <hi>the riches of the Gentiles;</hi> that is, enriched them with the Treaſures of Divine Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how much more would their fullneſs inrich them? If we referr this Clauſe (as we do) to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> before-named, the beſt ſenſe I can make of it is this, <hi>By whom I was educated and inſtructed.</hi> And then follows her making Him <hi>drink of ſpiced Wine</hi> (that is, making a great Feaſt for Him, <hi>IX. Prov. 2.</hi> where the moſt excellent Wine made the chiefeſt part of the Entertainment) ſuch Wine as makes thoſe who are aſleep to ſpeak, <hi>VII. 9.</hi> Which effect, the receiving of the Jews again will produce; as the Apoſtle tells us, when he ſaith, <hi>it ſhall be life from the dead:</hi> i. e. a moſt powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enliven the most stupid Souls, and move them to believe in Christ.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is that <hi>Harekach, ſpiced</hi> or <hi>Aromatick Wine,</hi> denotes its fragrancy or delicious odour; whereby the best Wines are diſcerned, as much as by their taste: and the Word we tranſlate <hi>Juice</hi> ſignifies every where, <hi>Muſte</hi> or <hi>new Wine:</hi> whereby the Prophets ſet forth ſomething that works with greater power and efficacy than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>IX. Zach. 17.</hi> And here, I doubt not, relates to ſomething new and unuſual: and, in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Application, may ſignifie a greater fullneſs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46873:208"/>and power of the Spirit, than had been in former days; working like new Wine in the hearts of thoſe that received the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>All this is ſaid to be done to <hi>Him,</hi> becauſe, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> noted before, what is done to his Members, he takes as done to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[c] V. 3.]</hi> Who is here repreſented, as immediately condeſcending to her deſires, and fulfilling her wiſhes: vouchſafing a new ſupply of the power of the Spirit, to ſupport and comfort her in thoſe labours of love for his names ſake. Which were ſo great, that ſhe is repreſented here, as ſpent and fainting away. So ſhe had been before, Chap. II. <hi>6.</hi> where ſee the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[d] V. 4.]</hi> This Verſe hath alſo been twice uſed before; with no difference from what we read here, but that now the mention of <hi>Hinds</hi> and <hi>Roes</hi> is left out; and yet he charges them with greater vehemence than ever. For the Hebrew Phraſe here ſignifies, as much as <hi>what do you do? why do you ſtir,</hi> &amp;c. that is, by no means; take heed how you diſturb her. See <hi>II. 7. III. 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[e] V. 5.]</hi> This ſeems to be the voice of her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> mentioned in the Verſe before (and begins the laſt part of this Song) admiring the new change they ſaw in her. For ſhe was repreſented before as <hi>coming out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs (III. 6.)</hi> but not <hi>leaning upon her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;</hi> as ſhe is here. Which ſignifies her advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto a ſtate of greater dearneſs to Him, and familiarity with Him.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>mithrappeketh,</hi> is not found elſewhere, and therefore variouſly tranſlated by Interpreters. But moſt agree that it ſignifies, either cloſely <hi>adhering,</hi> or <hi>leaning, relying,</hi> and <hi>recumbring,</hi> as they ſpeak: which <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> hath ſhown is the uſe of the Word in Neighbouring Languages. But there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46873:209"/>are thoſe who think it imports ſomething of pleaſure (and therefore the <hi>Vulgar</hi> takes in that ſenſe with the other; as I have in the Paraphraſe) and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it <hi>flowing with the delights.</hi> For ſhe having been in the Fields and Villages, viſiting the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and other places <hi>(VII. 11, 12, 13.)</hi> is now introduced as coming back from thence, into the Royal City. Which being ſeated on high, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the Plains out of which ſhe came, ſhe is ſaid to <hi>aſcend,</hi> or <hi>come up:</hi> but that ſhe might not be tired with the Journey, is repreſented as <hi>leaning upon the arm of her Beloved</hi> (or as ſome will have it, <hi>lying in his boſom,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> did in our Saviours) and laden with the delicious fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned <hi>(VII. 13.)</hi> Which excited the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that knew her, when they beheld the Grace of her Lord towards her; together with her own Beauty, Riches, Ornaments, and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>The latter part of the Verſe, all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers take to be the voice of the Bridegroom; and ſo do many of the <hi>Latines.</hi> But ſome of them, and all the Hebrew Writers take them to be the Words of the Spouſe; becauſe <hi>thee</hi> is of the Maſculine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Which ſoever way we take them, the ſenſe is very hard to find. If we go the firſt way, the moſt natural ſenſe ſeems to be, that He puts her in mind of the poor and mean condition, out of which He had taken her, into a ſtate of the greateſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Him: that ſhe might not be vainly puft up, with the acclamations which were made to her.</p>
                     <p>But I have followed the Hebrew Points, in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, and underſtood the Words of <hi>ſtirring up his love towards her,</hi> when they were looking after the Plantations mentioned, <hi>VII. 11, 12.</hi> Which was excited by the care and pains ſhe took in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; like the pains of a Woman in travail: unto which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compares the ſolicitude and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46873:209"/>care he had about the Galatians, that <hi>Chriſt might be formed in them. IV. 19.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certain it is that <hi>chibbeláh</hi> is a Word which relates to the pangs of travailing Women, and therefore the LXX tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: ſo that if I have not conjectured amiſs about the reſt, my interpretation of the laſt Words is natural enough. For <hi>Caph ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis</hi> (as they call it) is frequently omitted in the Scripture, and to be ſupplied by the ſenſe. Twice in this very Book it is wanting, <hi>I. 15. VII. 4. thy eyes are Doves,</hi> that is, <hi>as Doves:</hi> and in <hi>XVII. Prov. 21.</hi> and in his Father <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms very often, <hi>XI. Pſal. 1. How ſay you to my ſoul, flee a bird,</hi> i. e. as a Bird, <hi>to your hill:</hi> and to omit other places, <hi>CXIX. 119. Thou putteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the wicked of the earth, droſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>as</hi> or <hi>like</hi> droſs.</p>
                     <p>In like manner I take the laſt Words of this Verſe, <hi>there</hi> (viz. I ſtirred thee up) <hi>as thy mother travailed in birth with thee,</hi> there, <hi>I ſay, like her that brought thee forth:</hi> i. e. by ſuch pains as theſe I raiſed up thy love to me.</p>
                     <p>As for what is ſaid by many Interpreters, concerning <hi>Eve</hi>'s eating the Apple in Paradiſe, and thereby ruining all mankind; there is no reaſon to think, either that ſhe is the <hi>Mother</hi> here meant, or that <hi>Tappuach</hi> denotes an <hi>Apple,</hi> rather than <hi>Orange, Citron</hi> or ſuch like Fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[f] V. 6.]</hi> Theſe Words alſo, according to the Hebrew Points, are the Words of the Spouſe; beſeeching her Beloved to keep her always in his mind, as one very dear to Him. For that was the end of having the Name, or the Picture of a beloved perſon, engraven on a <hi>Seal,</hi> or <hi>Jewel,</hi> and wearing it next the heart, or upon the arm; that it might teſtifie their great eſteem of ſuch perſons, and the conſtancy of their affection towards them, and that they deſired they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46873:210"/>might never ſlip out of their memory. See <hi>XXII. Jer. 24.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some think here is an alluſion to the High Prieſt; who carried the names of the Children of Iſrael, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in Precious Stones, not only upon his Breaſt, but upon his Shoulders alſo; as may be ſeen, <hi>XXVIII. Exod. 11, 12, 21.</hi> and this, <hi>for a memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord continually,</hi> v. <hi>29.</hi> (Which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation may be confirmed by the Words of the Son of <hi>Syrach, XLV. Ecclus. 11.</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Aaron was adorned with Precious Stones, graven like Seals</hi>) And they think withal, that <hi>Seal upon the heart</hi> relates to the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>Seal on the arm,</hi> to the outward expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love and eſteem.</p>
                     <p>And then follows the reaſon of this Prayer; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the vehemence of her love, which was grown to the heighth of jealouſie (which is nothing but the higheſt degree of love) leſt ſhe ſhould loſe Him, as ſhe had been in danger before, <hi>V. 6, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This love is ſaid to be <hi>as ſtrong as death:</hi> which is admirably expreſſed by <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> Diſſert. X. — <hi>wild Beaſts are not terrible to it, nor fire, nor precipices, nor the ſea, nor the ſword, nor the halter,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. but even the moſt unpaſſable difficulties are got over by it; the hardeſt things are preſently maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the moſt frightful eaſily ſurmounted,</hi> &amp;c. it is every where <hi>confident, overlooks all things, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowers all things,</hi> &amp;c. But none expreſs this, like St. <hi>Paul, VIII. Rom. 35, 36, 37, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no difficulty but in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe (for <hi>as ſtrong as death,</hi> ſignifies it to be inſuperable; ſo <hi>cruel as the grave,</hi> denotes it not to be moved by prayers, and entreaties, or any thing elſe.) Where the Word <hi>reſchapéha</hi> ſhould not be tranſlated, <hi>the coals thereof,</hi> but the <hi>arrows thereof are arrows
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46873:210"/>of fire.</hi> That is, it ſhoots into the heart, wounds it, and burns there; nay, inflames it vehemently by the wounds it gives; as the Reverend and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath obſerved upon <hi>LXXVI. Pſal. 3.</hi> And ſo the LXX ſeem here to underſtand it, when they tranſlate it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>its Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Wings, wherewith it flies,</hi> are <hi>Wings of fire.</hi> Which Wings or Arrows of Fire, are ſaid, in the laſt Words of all, to be a <hi>moſt vehement flame,</hi> or rather it ſhould be thus tranſlated, <hi>which are the flames of fire of the Lord.</hi> So the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Word ſeems to ſignifie, being compounded of <hi>three</hi> Words, <hi>fire, flame,</hi> and <hi>the Lord:</hi> denoting mighty and exceeding ſcorching flames. Such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are not only to be found in other parts of the Bible <hi>(II. Jer. 31.)</hi> but in the Punick language alſo as <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſhows in his <hi>Canaan,</hi> L. II. C. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some tranſlate it, <hi>Such flames are kindled only by the Lord.</hi> And then, if there be an alluſion to the Breaſt-plate of the High Prieſt, in the beginning of the Verſe, I fanſie the concluſion may allude to the <hi>fire that went out from before the Lord</hi> (<hi>IX.</hi> Lev. <hi>24.</hi> and devoured the Sacrifices, as Love doth all manner of difficulties. This Fire was to burn perpetually upon the Altar, and never be ſuffered to go out, <hi>VI. Levit. 12.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt Emblem of love that could be found.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[g] V. 7.]</hi> For it is unextingniſhable as it here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Many waters cannot quench love.</hi> Which is a Metaphor, whereby prophane Authors alſo have ſet forth the mighty, unconquerable power of love. — <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; <hi>&amp;c. What new kind of conflagration is this?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in one of his Epiſtles) <hi>I am ready to call for water, and there is none to bring it,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>for a Quencher for this fire, is the moſt impoſſible to be found. If
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46873:211"/>one bring it from the Fountain, or if he take it out of the River, it is all one; for the water it ſelf is burnt up by love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>many waters</hi> are ſometimes meant, in Scripture, <hi>many afflictions</hi> (as is very well known) which they that love, frequently endure, before they can accompliſh their deſire. But though there ſhould be an <hi>inundation</hi> of them, we are here told, they cannot <hi>overwhelm,</hi> or <hi>overflow</hi> it; as the Word we tranſlate <hi>drown'd</hi> ſignifies: but it will ſtill live and be uppermoſt, and prevail.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch is its conſtancy, and ſatisfaction alſo which it hath in its own pleaſures, it regards not riches at all; but will rather be poor with one whom it affects, than enjoy great poſſeſſions with another perſon. Nay, it deſpiſes, and that with diſdain, the offers of a mans whole Eſtate; if that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be impoſed, of forſaking its love. Others may laugh, perhaps, at ſuch perſons; but, it is all one, they ſmile at them again. So <hi>Theodoret</hi> and the LXX underſtand the latter part of this Verſe, <hi>if a man give away all his ſubſtance in Charity, they will extremely deſpiſe him.</hi> That is, ſaith he, they that ſpend all they have, and their very lives, for the love of God, are ſet at nought by thoſe that want ſuch love. Other Interpretations of theſe Words I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[h] V. 8.]</hi> Here is another property of Divine love, which makes us ſolicitous for thoſe that want it; or have but the beginnings of it, and may be in danger to loſe them. And this ſeems to be the Speech of the Spouſe to her Companions, who were all troubled for a <hi>Siſter</hi> (that is, ſome Church) which was of a ſmall growth, and had <hi>no Breaſts;</hi> that is, was not ripe for Marriage. For all have Breaſts; but they do not riſe and ſwell, till they are of ſuch an Age, that they may be called <hi>Women, XVI. Ezek.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46873:211"/>7.</hi> They enquire therefore what they ſhould do for her, <hi>in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for?</hi> that is, demanded in marriage. Or <hi>when there ſhall be ſpeech concerning her;</hi> that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this defect of hers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[i] V. 9.]</hi> Here He returns an Anſwer to that Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is, that He and they will take the greater care for her; to raiſe her ſtature, and to bring her to perfection. For where there are good beginnings, we are not wont to forſake them: but rather to add to them and improve them. As for example, the Wall of a Building which we eſteem, we do not ſuffer to fall to the ground, but ſtrengthen and raiſe it: nay, adorn it ſometimes and beautifie it with Towres and Pinnacles; which we ſtick not to gild, that they may appear more gloriouſly. Or if it be a Door of a Houſe, which we value, we let it not decay; but rather caſe it with Boards of <hi>Cedar,</hi> to make it more durable, as well as neat and handſome: for <hi>Cedar</hi> is not apt to putrefie.</p>
                     <p>This ſeems to me the moſt ſimple Expoſition of theſe Words; and I do not think fit to trouble the Reader with that vaſt variety, which may be found in Interpreters. But only add, that they may very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be applied unto a Soul, or a Church in a ſtate of imperfection; but built upon Chriſt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in this manner, <hi>Let her but be firm and conſtant, like a Wall, in her love to me, and I will not abandon the care of her; let her but exclude all other, and open to me alone, and ſhe ſhall never want any thing neceſſary to her perfection: for I will richly adorn her, and make her like the Houſe of God Himſelf; which is lined with Cedar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[k] V. 10.]</hi> And then this Verſe, may be thus applied (being her Anſwer) <hi>I am reſolved to do what thou requireſt (to be ſtedfaſt and faithful) and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46873:212"/>already perceive the reward of my fidelity,</hi> &amp;c. For theſe Words plainly relate to the foregoing, as I have expreſſed it in the Paraphraſe: unto which I ſhall add nothing; for if that be admitted, there is no difficulty in them. It being known to every Body, that <hi>ſhalom, peace,</hi> ſignifies all manner of happineſs in the Hebrew Language: which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded alſo in our Engliſh Word <hi>favour,</hi> whereby we here tranſlate it. For it ſignifies all the good things, that may be expected from the favour He bears to any perſon</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[l] V. 11.]</hi> And being thus <hi>favoured</hi> by Him, ſhe now promiſes her diligence (in this and the next Verſe) to do Him the beſt ſervice, and to make the greateſt improvements ſhe could of the Talents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her. For though <hi>Solomon</hi> (ſhe here ſaith) let cut his Vineyard, which he had in <hi>Baal-hamon,</hi> a place near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> tells us (which is followed by moſt Interpreters, few think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be near <hi>Engaddi</hi>) where abundance of people had Vineyards, and he a very large one: for it being let to ſeveral Fermers, every one paid him a <hi>thouſand pieces of Silver,</hi> i. e. Shekels (as much as to ſay, it brought him in a vaſt revenue yearly; for a <hi>thouſand</hi> is a Summ of perfection, <hi>CXLIV. Pſal. 3. V. Micah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> and other places, and the number of Farmers or Tenants, though not expreſſed, ſome think, to be <hi>ten</hi>) yet ſhe takes up another reſolution; which ſhe expreſſes in the next Verſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[m] V. 12.]</hi> Where ſhe ſaith ſhe will her ſelf look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vineyard committed to her truſt; and not leave it to the care of others. Which ſeems to be the meaning of the firſt Phraſe in this Verſe, <hi>My Vineyard which I have is before me,</hi> i.e. is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my eye (as we ſpeak) and ſpecial care. Thus God's Judgments are ſaid to be before <hi>David, XVIII. Pſal. 22.</hi> that is, He took great care never to ſwerve from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:46873:212"/>
It amounts alſo to the ſame ſenſe, if we take this Phraſe to ſignifie as much, as <hi>it is in my power, XLVII. Gen. 5. XL. Jer. 4.</hi> For then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, ſhe kept it in her own hand, or occupation; and did not farm it out to others.</p>
                     <p>And then the laſt part of the Verſe ſignifies, that if <hi>Solomon</hi> made ſuch a profit of his Vineyard, as that before-named (beſides <hi>two hundred</hi> Shekels; which each of the Farmers got over and above for their pains) though he did not dreſs it himſelf; what would be the encreaſe, that ſhe was likely to make by her own care and diligence in the buſineſs. That is, it was incredible what fruit ſhe would reap by her pains: according to that of the Son of <hi>Syrach, XXIV. Ecclus 31, &amp;c. I ſaid I will water my beſt Garden, and I will water abundantly my Garden-Bed, and lo, my Brook became a River, and my River became Sea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This ſeems to me the moſt natural ſenſe of theſe two difficult Verſes; which <hi>Almonazir</hi> ſuggeſted to my thoughts. And that <hi>Solomon,</hi> not any other perſon, is here intended, <hi>Maimonides</hi> himſelf agrees; who in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Foundation of the Law,</hi> C. VII. hath theſe Words: <hi>Whereſoever you meet with the name of</hi> Solomon, <hi>in the Book of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <hi>it is holy; as the reſt of the names there are: ſave only in that place, a thouſand are to thee, O Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. Others alſo add that place, <hi>III. Cant. 7. Behold the Bed which is Solomons,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Maſters ſay, it is a common name, as well as here.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Verſes are ingeniouſly applied by ſome, to the far greater encreaſe of knowledge and goodneſs in the <hi>Church,</hi> than in the <hi>Synagogue:</hi> that is by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, than by Judaiſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[n] V. 13.]</hi> This Verſe, according to the Hebrew Points, is the voice of the <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> who ſeems
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46873:213"/>to commend the reſolution ſhe made, in the foregoing Verſe. And he calling her <hi>the inhabitant of the gardens</hi> (which are the ſame with the <hi>Vineyard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) it ſignifies her perpetual care about their proſperity. In recompence of which He bids her, before they finiſh this interview, to ask what ſhe will of Him, and it ſhall be done for her. Which, in ſhort, is the ſumm of what the ſame <hi>Almonazir</hi> hath long ago conjectured to be the ſenſe of this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[o] V. 14]</hi> Unto which ſhe returns her Anſwer, in theſe Words; and ſo ſhuts up this Song. Which ſeems to me to conclude as it begun; with a deſire that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would come, and make good all thoſe things, that had been repreſented in theſe rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>berach,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>make haſte,</hi> is twice tranſlated by the LXX <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to <hi>go</hi> or <hi>run thorow,</hi> to the very end. <hi>XXVI. Exod. 28. XXXVI. 32.</hi> And no doubt, denotes here moſt vehement and reſtleſs endeavours, in a ſpeedy courſe: like that of a <hi>Roe Buck,</hi> or <hi>wild Goat</hi> rather; whoſe agility, both in running and jumping is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by all Authors, and ſaid to be ſuch as is ſcarce credible.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>young hart</hi> (called here <hi>opher</hi>) is ſtill more ſwift and nimble than the old: the exceeding great fear wherein it is, adding Wings (as we ſpeak) to its feet. Whence <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith, there is nothing comparable to their ſwiftneſs, when the old ones are abſent, and they are purſued by Dogs: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then there is no ſpeed like to that of ſuch young Harts, as his Words are quoted by <hi>Bochartus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who well obſerves (L. III. C. XVII. Part. <hi>1. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi>) that the ſenſe of the laſt Words (<hi>upon the mountains,</hi> &amp;c.) is to be made out by adding one Word, in this manner, <hi>Be thou like the young
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46873:213"/>Harts running</hi> (or <hi>when they run</hi>) <hi>upon the mountains of ſpices,</hi> i. e. the Mountains where Spices grow; ſuch as thoſe mentioned <hi>IV. 6.</hi> Such perhaps was <hi>Bether, II. 17.</hi> (where we meet with theſe Words before) and I have ſometime thought, that they ſhould be ſo tranſlated here, <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Beſamim;</hi> as there the Mountains of <hi>Bether.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what theſe Mountains were we are now ignorant though this is certain, that the Creatures here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were bred in the higheſt Mountains of the Country; as <hi>Aelian</hi> teſtifies in the latter end of his <hi>fifth</hi> Book: <hi>The Harts in</hi> Syria <hi>are bred in their higheſt Mountains,</hi> Amanus, Libanus, <hi>and</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. For there they were ſafeſt and moſt ſecure from danger; there it was difficult to purſue them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they climbed up the ſteepeſt places. And therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> when they would repreſent themſelves as in a ſtate of perfect ſecurity, ſay God had <hi>made their feet like hinds feet, and made them to walk upon their (bamoth) high places, XVIII. Pſal. 33. III. Hab.</hi> ult. Which Words allude to the inacceſſible Mountains, which thoſe Creatures frequented; eſpecially the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, that they might there ſecure their young ones. Beſides, as there they could feed and bring forth their young moſt ſecurely; ſo there was the ſweeteſt feeding.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſeems to long for the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> doth for his laſt: who concludes his Book of the Revelation in the ſame manner as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth this: ſaying, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, XXII. Revel. 20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are thoſe who fanſie that in the foregoing Verſe the Bridegroom asks her conſent, for the perfecting their love in Marriage; and deſires her in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her Companions to lift up her voice and ſing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46873:214"/>the <hi>Nuptial Hymn:</hi> Which ſhe now, ſay they, in this Verſe profeſſes her ſelf to be ready to do; if He would but be preſent with her, and aſſiſt and direct her to do it aright. And then it is thus applied and paraphraſed by the fore-named <hi>Almonazit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou commandeſt me that I ſhould with Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening Hymns and Songs celebrate thy Omnipotent Wiſdom and Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe then ſpeedily to adjoyn the eternal force and flame of thy Holy Spirit unto my voice; that in ſpirit, and truth, and ſanctity of heart, I may ſing thy praiſes: and not only with my mouth and ſound; but in my mind and heart eſpecially, worthily worſhip thy incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Majeſty.</hi>
